<p class="keys">Nathan had nothing to do with it. Hell I'll bet that to this day Nathan 
doesn't even know h e's connected to those two bombs. Nathan is innocent. But 
then again so is Ted. Personally, I am so glad that Dr Gelernter survived the 
bomb. He is a great scientist and I really admire his distributed language 
approach to massive data processing. However, He is small potatoes compared to 
the &quot;big picture&quot;. Funny, but everyone thinks this case is over, but the big 
stuff is yet to come. It will change American Society Forever when it does. No 
one will ever view the government the same when the real truth comes out...and 
they should not...They will not !</p>
