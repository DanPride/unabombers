</p>
<p class="story">
&quot;Miss Boylan?&quot; 
</p>
<p class="story">
A tap on my shoulder snapped me out of my daydream. 
</p>
<p class="story">
&quot;Yes?&quot;
</p>
<p class="story">
&quot;FBI. We have a witness in the Unabom case. I need you to come with me.&quot;
</p>
<p class="story">
My heart took a free fall inside my chest, pressing
against my lungs, shortening my breath to a few jagged gulps. The Unabom case?
But how had they tracked me down? I was merely trying to change planes on my
way home after a long and exhausting case. I hadn't even noticed the clean-cut
man in the dark blue suit. I must have passed right by him, searching for the
gate number written in grease pencil on the face of my airline ticket.
</p>
<p class="story">
Where would he take me? And why now? My mind raced for
some legitimate form of resistance, some explanation. 
</p>
<p class="story">
&quot;But, I can't go with you, I've got luggage!&quot;
</p>
<p class="story">
&quot;We've got your luggage.&quot;
</p>
<p class="story">
That change of planes in San Francisco in July 1994
represented a rare and needed break from my usual crazed rush through airports.
The pressure from my latest case was finally behind me: my sketches were
finished, and the presses were cranking out wanted posters for mass
distribution. Finally I was headed home, just four hours and ten minutes to go.
</p>
<p class="story">
As I dodged other harried passengers through the airport
corridor, my mind drifted to my country home in Bend, Oregon. I imagined my
yellow Labrador pup, Dillon, spilling out the front door of our log house,
skidding sideways in the gravel driveway as he rounded the curve in his rush to
greet me.
</p>
<p class="story">
I could almost smell the welcomed aroma of the hot, dry
air, a mixture of juniper and pine, tinged even in the high-desert summer with
the faint scent of pine-fueled stoves. That pitchy smell always seeps into the
airplane cabin the moment the flight attendant pops open the door, as if to
provide confirmation that I'm really home. The locals around Bend say that if
you inhale the rugged fragrance long enough, you start to take it for granted.
I wouldn't know. My work steals me away too often.
</p>
<p class="story">
I've spent most of my adult life probing the minds of
crime victims and eyewitnesses to capture memories, exorcise fears, to draw out
detailed recollections of the violators' faces so they can be apprehended
before striking again.
</p>
<p class="story">
I once read that some people study faces in a crowd in
hope of finding their predestined lover. I used to flirt with such intentions
too, but that was long before I started searching instead, for faces that steal
dreams.
</p>
<p class="story">
Faces haunt me: every nuance, every angle, every shadow,
every line. I slip through the world sizing up their shapes and colors and
textures. At a glance I notice if eyes are wet or iced, if they're squinty or
withholding, if scars are new or smooth, if skin is oiled or abused.
</p>
<p class="story">
On my way to an investigation, every minute matters. A
suspect is at large and might soon leave his mark again. I'm brought in to
bring to life the detailed face of the kidnapper or the bomber, the killer or
the rapist.
</p>
<p class="story">
My home town of Bend, Oregon, rests in the shadow of the
Three Sisters Mountains, just east of the Cascades. If I hadn't been detoured
by an FBI agent, I'd have arrived just in time to catch the last streams of
evening sunlight sifting through the towering ponderosa pines and the tall blades
of high-desert grass.
</p>
<p class="story">
As I'd migrated through the San Francisco airport on my
way to my connecting gate, the aroma of fresh-baked pizza had stirred my hunger
- a lousy trick played on famished commuters like me, used to living on giant
Snickers bars and lukewarm Snapple from pricey hotel minibars. To have
something hot and edible seemed like a dream. But a lineup of newspaper front
pages had diverted my attention from my empty stomach.
</p>
<p class="story">
The word <i>murder</i> topped the local headline, and
for a moment I nearly forgot which city I was in. The story drew me back to
Albuquerque and Flagstaff, two Southwest cities on opposite ends of a stretch
of old highway where a car-jacking had ended in the gruesome murder of
sixteen-year-old Jonathan Francia. I'd just spent the past five days doing
interviews and suspect drawings in an attempt to identify his killer. It was
still too soon for any news on the case, yet I was hoping there might be an
early breakthrough as I walked toward the concourse security checkpoint, but
the sudden tap on my shoulder by the FBI agent interrupted my thoughts.
</p>
<p class="story">
At first I thought I must have dropped something, maybe
a receipt. The word <i>thanks</i> began to form on the edge of my lips. When I
turned and looked into the eyes of the intruder, I immediately knew better. I
recognized the look: the regulation haircut and the generic dark suit - all
that was missing was the usual mustache, trimmed to the corners and above the
lip line. He had to be a cop.
</p>
<p class="story">
A leather badge case sprang open in front of me.
&quot;FBI,&quot; he announced, then apologetically added, &quot;Max Noel,
ma'am.&quot; The airport crowd kept flowing around us, oblivious, as if he'd
done nothing more than ask me for the time of day.
</p>
<p class="story">
His presence meant only one thing: that once again I'd
be turned away from my plans and back to the job that possessed me.
</p>
<p class="story">
I feigned a &quot;professional&quot; smile and followed
him back up the concourse, leaving my homebound flight on the other side of the
terminal.
</p>
<p class="story">
As we walked through SFO, past the glassed-in exhibits
of antique toys, Agent Noel strained from the weight of the three-ring binders
under his arm. They were stuffed with case reports and photocopies of evidence
right down to canceled postage stamps recovered from the suspect's deadly
packages. Wasting no time, he launched into a rapid-paced Unabom introductory
course, with emphasis on the national security implications. 
</p>
<p class="story">
I listened, but my mind wandered between his words. Some
of it I didn't want to hear. Instead, I kept thinking about the phone call I
had to make. Agent Noel was talking about the biggest case in FBI history, and
I was worrying more about what my husband would say. Would he see this as an
unavoidable occupational hazard or just another shattered pledge? I shook the
thought aside and forced myself to pay attention.
</p>
<p class="story">
To keep the boundary strong between my two worlds, when
I had time at home I worked hard to avoid the news, so when Agent Noel flipped
open his badge case, I didn't know that the Unabomber was America's most wanted
killer. I didn't know that he'd been on a killing spree for fifteen years. Or
that he'd left a string of junkyard bombs that reached back to 1978, when he'd
taken his first aim at a professor at the Technological Institute of
Northwestern University near Chicago. The FBI agent filled me in on the case
background as he walked me to a seat near our departure gate.
</p>
<p class="story">
In 1979, the phantom bomber hit an American Airlines
flight, where one of his creations malfunctioned and caught fire, forcing an
emergency landing and injuring a dozen people. Had the bomb exploded at
cruising altitude as planned, the casualties would have been beyond
comprehension.
</p>
<p class="story">
Next he targeted the president of United Airlines, then
the computer-science departments at Vanderbilt University and the University of
California at Berkeley. In 1985 he mailed a bomb to the fabrication department
of the Boeing Company near Seattle, but fast-thinking security agents
discovered it before it wreaked its intended havoc.
</p>
<p class="story">
Other targets weren't so lucky. By 1994, the Unabomber's
work had seriously injured twenty-two victims and killed a Sacramento man who
was ripped apart by a bomb disguised as an ordinary package.
</p>
<p class="story">
The FBI, the United States Postal Service, and the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms concluded that the tragedies were all
the work of a single entity. The FBI organized a task force with two primary
units based in the San Francisco and Chicago FBI offices. They named the case
&quot;Unabom&quot; - <i>un</i>  for <i>university</i> and <i>a</i> for <i>airlines,</i>
the early targets of devastation; and <i>bom</i> as an abbreviation for <i>bomber.</i>
</p>
<p class="story">
Agent Noel knew every detail by heart. For an FBI agent,
this case was no easy assignment. They still had no suspect, there was no
demand for money, and each detonation left no traceable evidence. The Unabomber
crafted his own explosives and carefully covered his tracks, leaving no
fingerprints, no strands of hair, no fabric fibers. But almost as a taunt, he
&quot;signed&quot; his works by using unique homemade components where simple
store-bought materials would have worked as well. 
</p>
<p class="story">
His bombs were meticulously constructed, the parts
numbered prior to assembly and, based on analysis of the fragments, built and
rebuilt repeatedly. He incorporated an indestructible piece into each one -
etched with the initials <i>FC</i> - as if to say, &quot;I was here. I have
power.&quot; Then he'd enclose a clue or two, often some reference to wood -
the material he used as a basis for his bombs and the topic for his cryptic
comments - before sending them off to do their damage. 
</p>
<p class="story">
In the mid eighties, he changed his tactic, personally
placing rather than mailing his bombs. He dropped out of the news until 1993,
when he resurfaced, first with a letter bomb to the California home of a
world-famous geneticist, and two days later with a bomb mailed to a
computer-science professor at Yale University. 
</p>
<p class="story">
Then, as if to be sure everyone knew he was still around
and kicking, he sent a letter to the assistant managing editor of the <i>New
York Times,</i> claiming to be the representative of an anarchist group called
FC. By that time, Janet Reno was attorney general, and in her no-nonsense
manner, she lifted the lid off funding of the FBI investigation, fueling the
intensified search that led to my 1994 interception in the San Francisco
airport. </span></p>
<p class="story">
Agent Noel filled me in on the assignment: I would be
interviewing the only person known to have actually seen the Unabomber. Her
identity had been carefully protected; she and her family had relocated three
times over the past seven years to escape detection by the media. 
</p>
<p class="story">
I took a close look at the seasoned agent in the dark
suit, now in his late fifties. In other circumstances, I would have found his
kind face and gentle manner endearing, maybe even charming. He'd done his
career stint and could have traded his badge in for a comfortable pension and a
golf club membership, but he refused to abandon his decade-long quest to
capture the elusive murderer. 
</p>
<p class="story">
As we stood in line to board, I began to unload some of
my own frustrations that went with being an in-the-wings resource in the
investigative world. I was lamenting that by the time I got to an eyewitness,
the by-the-book investigative composite process had usually managed to all but
destroy the malleable impression of the suspect's face. 
</p>
<p class="story">
In a sentence, I was usually working against all odds to
retrieve what was once an intact image of the assailant, one that had
inadvertently been bungled by the very process of trying to create the face. 
</p>
<p class="story">
&quot;It makes me crazy,&quot; I told Agent Noel.
&quot;The case I'm just returning from, the Jonathan Francia car-jack murder,
is six months old. Can you believe that? The television program <i>Unsolved
Mysteries</i> called to get my help. They'd planned a feature around the case <i>six
months after the fact.</i> There were only contaminated eyewitness memories
left to work with, witnesses had been shown so many other faces they couldn't
remember <i>what</i> they'd actually seen, faulty police sketches had been
broadcast for months, leaving the police and the FBI no credibility at all in
the public's eyes.&quot; I shook my head. The early swell of public interest,
crucial to the kind of break we needed, was all wasted on misinformation. The
trail was stone cold, and the family devastated. It was another mess - a
six-month-old mess. 
</p>
<p class="story">
It actually felt good to vent. An investigator of Agent
Noel's caliber - used to the highest-profile cases - would understand the
frustration when something so seemingly simple went so needlessly wrong. 
</p>
<p class="story">
He listened, then screwed his face into a knot, hoisted
his shoulders almost to his ears, and looked up through the thickness of his
eyebrows in a &quot;don't kill me now&quot; pose while he slowly squeezed out
the words, &quot;Did, uh, I mention that, um, this Unabomber witness I'm taking
you to see...saw the guy seven and a half years ago?&quot; 
</p>
<p class="story">
My jaw dropped. My feet refused to move forward. I
couldn't make a single word emerge from my mouth. He had to be kidding. 
</p>
<p class="story"><a name="UnhappyWitness" href="SketchComparisons.htm#UnhappyWitness">
He pulled out the 1987 Unabom case composite of a
pointy-chinned, ruddy-faced, redheaded, blue-eyed man with a mustache, wearing
a hooded sweatshirt. &quot;This is the image we want you to correct. It's the
only thing we've had to go by, but from the day we first released it, we've had
an unhappy witness. She's maintained that this is not the right face. We need
you to reinterview her and find out what went wrong.&quot;</a>
</p>
<p class="story">
Noel could read the sentiment in my eyes. I looked away
while he told me more. On February 20, 1987, a bomb had exploded in a parking
lot in Salt Lake City. Three days later an initial attempt at a suspect sketch
was prepared in haste by an FBI artist. But it was mechanical, flat, and
according to the witness, &quot;wrong.&quot; A second artist then entered the
case, brought in through a social tie to a police lieutenant involved in the
investigation of a potentially related 1985 event. That artist spent weeks
toying with his version in a belabored effort to please the eyewitness but only
took the image even further away from what she'd seen. 
</p>
<p class="story">
Out of desperation, though, his drawing was released on
March 10, 1987, despite the witness's protest. To create more trouble, because
of her complaints, the artist continued to tamper with it for yet another week.
The artwork kept getting more refined, while the image grew even more unrelated
to what the witness had actually seen. And worst of all, the sole witness's
memory in the fifteen-year-old case was being contorted in the drawn-out
process. 
</p>
<p class="story">
The misdirection of the case over the seven years had
been costly, not just in departmental dollars and hours spent pursuing leads
based on a wrong image, but in terms of public danger as the terrorist
continued planning his rampage, unconcerned about being linked to the face then
depicted on the wanted posters. 
</p>
<p class="story">
As much as I appreciated the Bureau's faith in my
abilities, I was exasperated by the obstacles in my path. Every precaution
should have been taken to protect the evidence. Yet even at the FBI level,
investigators still seemed not to comprehend that a memory in an eyewitness's
mind <i>is</i> evidence. And in this high-profile case, the primary evidence
had been dragged through the mud - more than once. 
</p>
<p class="story">
The analogy is simple. If a fingerprint is found on a
gun, a knife, or perhaps a glass at a murder scene, detectives guard that
evidence with their lives, carefully picking it up with an implement and
placing it into an evidence bag, untouched and protected. They'd never let it
be smudged, knowing that once it was, those prints would likely be
irretrievable. Yet, an &quot;imprint&quot; in an eyewitness's memory is <i>just</i>
as fragile and in fact even <i>more</i> smudgeable than a fingerprint on a
murder weapon, yet rarely is it treated with equal care. 
</p>
<p class="story">
Instead, the delicate eyewitness image obtained during
the crime is routinely smeared, distorted, and contaminated by police agencies
as they attempt to create a composite drawing of the suspect.
</p>
<p class="story">
In standard police practice, witnesses are bombarded
with mug shots and catalogs of facial photos so that they can point out a
multitude of features that look something like what they've seen - like picking
out your lost luggage by pointing to an airline baggage chart full of handles,
fabrics, latches, and locks. If only the human psyche were so wonderfully
simple - but it's not. 
</p>
<p class="story">
Shockingly, compositry is an aspect of investigations
that has never been given academic thought. Few investigators question how a
drawing is produced, just so long as they end up with one in hand. 
</p>
<p class="story">
Common belief is that if the artwork is good, then the
information it conveys must be good as well. But that belief is dangerously
wrong. There is no correlation between the impressiveness of the artwork and
the accuracy of its information. The answers to uncovering memory reside not in
artistic ability, but in understanding the powerful inner workings of the human
mind - and more importantly, in the power of the human heart. 
</p>
<p class="story">
I started tallying up the odds against success as we
taxied down the runway. Noel was describing the longest reign of terror in the
country's history: multiple fatalities, overwhelming pressure from the media,
and the highest imaginable scrutiny by the government. He was escorting me to
interview the sole eyewitness from a seven-year-old sighting, and he was asking
me to do - <i>what?</i> 
</p>
<p class="story">
&quot;So tell me about this process of yours,&quot;
Agent Noel said as he loosened his necktie. Then he posed the one question that
really mattered: &quot;And do you think we even have a chance at this?&quot; 
</p>
<p class="story">
Despite all the bad news, I <i>did</i> believe we had at
least a shot. With a two-hour flight still ahead, I'd try to use the time to
explain why. 
</p>
<p class="story">
&quot;Under ordinary circumstances, a
seven-and-a-half-year time lapse might be an overwhelming obstacle to
recovering a memory,&quot; I began, &quot;but in this case, we're not dealing
with ordinary circumstances. We have a couple of factors in our favor. The
first is the high degree of emotional upheaval the eyewitness experienced. The
mind holds great power to encode or record detail into its memory if an event
evokes emotion, and especially if it threatens a person's own sense of
security.&quot; I knew he'd understand the concept more clearly if I used
examples that he'd lived through himself. 
</p>
<p class="story">
&quot;Remember hearing the news about the assassination
of President Kennedy, or perhaps about the explosion of the space shuttle? Both
events took place years ago, yet most people recall them with precision and can
even cite with detail the exact moment as they lived it, down to the
temperature of the air, the song on the radio, the color of a teacher's dress
when she walked into the classroom bearing the news. It's all still there. But
asked to describe the day before, or the day after, the memory has long since
released all nonpertinent detail.&quot; He nodded in understanding. 
</p>
<p class="story">
&quot;The same thing occurs when the mind experiences
the trauma of being witness to or a victim of crime. That's the good news, but
there's a catch,&quot; I explained.
</p>
<p class="story">
&quot;Because the crime victim experiences the traumatic
event personally, the mind, as a survival measure, acts with determination to
protect the victim from reexperiencing the event by repressing the image that
induced the trauma. Emotions arise and act to buffer the harsh reality from the
conscious mind. The mind then strives to alter the memory in any way it can, to
make that image more emotionally palatable.
</p>
<p class="story">
&quot;A crime victim will go through a series of 'if
only's.' If only I had taken a different route, if only I'd followed my
intuition, if only...It's part of the mind's effort to rework the event in
order to master the emotion. The mind tries hard to achieve distance from the
trauma to allow the victim to move forward, to move on to safety and to regain
function. This sets the stage for disaster when interviewing high-trauma
witnesses and victims, who are highly susceptible to influence and suggestion.
You see, they are trying on a conscious level to recall the images of those who
brought the experience of terror into their lives -- while subconsciously their
minds are trying to repress the same information. Their minds will willingly
grasp at whatever information is presented, verbally or visually.&quot; Noel
listened closely. 
</p>
<p class="story">
&quot;The good news to investigators - and to this case
- is that the subconscious mind often holds the true detail intact, though it's
typically buried securely underneath what the conscious mind has allowed in as
its new 'truth.' &quot; Noel nodded in understanding and leaned in a little
closer. 
</p>
<p class="story">
&quot;Here's the irony. Without meaning to do so,
investigators or police artists actually help to bury the image every time they
present a victim with a photo of someone other than the actual suspect. Their
hope is that the victim can simply point at something visual and say, 'The nose
is just like that,' or 'The chin is like that,' based on the theory that
recognition is easier than recall. The recognition method of 'identification'
works sometimes, but more so in nontraumatic circumstances - for instance to
describe someone who cashed a bad check. There's no trauma involved in that
kind of an encounter, so the mind has no reason to protect itself from the
memory. But to this day, that single approach is the one used by police when
creating a drawing, no matter the scenario involved in the case.&quot; The
flight attendant handed us our drinks as I continued.
</p>
<p class="story">
&quot;There are now decades of research proving that
when emotion is introduced, every single dynamic of how memory functions
changes. By showing eyewitnesses books of facial photos from which to choose
look-alike images, the well-meaning police or police artists are literally handing
to the eyewitness - at the very height of that person's vulnerability to
suggestion and influence - the visual tools to effectively discard, distort or
further entomb the actual image that created the trauma. They are, in effect,
not producing but rather unknowingly aiding in <i>destroying</i> evidence. The
academic world understands this, but the police system hasn't caught up. They
still assume that this work is all about art.&quot; 
</p>
<p class="story">
His eyes lit up. &quot;It makes so much sense! It's so
simple, yet...&quot; 
</p>
<p class="story">
I finished his thought for him while he began to realize
the magnitude of the errors already made. &quot;Think about this: What happens
if you hold film still in a camera and repeatedly open the shutter? What
happens to your original imprint on the film with each exposure? It is so
simple, you're right; yet through lack of awareness, those who are trying
wholeheartedly to help are potentially disabling the witness from ever having
the ability to identify a suspect when one is apprehended. 
</p>
<p class="story">
&quot;We might still have hope,&quot; I told him.
&quot;You see, if we can coach the conscious mind to move aside, sometimes we
can still access the original untainted image -- <i>if</i> there is reason
enough for it to have been retained in memory. The higher the degree of
personal trauma, the harder the mind works to discard or bury the image, but,
also, the more likely it will have been encoded into memory in the first place,
even if it's housed at a much deeper level of recall.&quot; Noel sighed as he
listened. 
</p>
<p class="story">
&quot;To put the concept into more tangible terms,&quot;
I explained, &quot;think of it like this: Searching for the encoded image in
the eyewitness's mind is comparable to retrieving a fifty-cent piece that's
been tossed into eight feet of water. The fifty-cent piece rests at the bottom
of the pool, just as it originally existed, but the image of it is distorted
through the eight feet of water - or, through the emotional aftermath that
follows a traumatic event. Then to make it even more difficult to see, that
same water gets muddied and rippled, as does the image of the suspect by the
bombardment of visual contaminants offered by police artists and investigators.
</p>
<p class="story">
&quot;My job is to try to get through that muddied and
rippled water and to bring that coin back to the surface of the pool - or, in
real terms, to bring back into the eyewitness's conscious memory that original
image, in its original condition. 
</p>
<p class="story">
&quot;In the case of the Unabomber witness, the
magnitude of the trauma she experienced was likely sufficient for her mind to
encode the vision of the suspect into her short-term recall and - more
important - to transfer it into her long-term memory. But the big question now
is, Under how many feet of muddy water does that coin lie? 
</p>
<p class="story"><a name="Optimism" href="SketchComparisons.htm">
&quot;The reason for optimism is, ironically, the
eyewitness's aggravation over the last sketch. That frustration might have
helped lock in her original memory at a subliminal level no matter how much
contamination the image has since been exposed to.&quot;</a>
</p>
<p class="story">
Seat backs went up as we began our descent. 
</p>
<p class="story">
&quot;We've blown it in this case without ever even
realizing it, haven't we?&quot; Agent Noel asked. &quot;All those years, all
those wrong leads...&quot;
</p>
<p class="story">
&quot;Maybe not,&quot; I answered. &quot;It will all
depend on the emotional investment of your witness. We won't know until we try.
But despite the odds, it's always worth trying.&quot; 
</p>
<p class="story">
The summer sun was just starting to sink over the Great
Salt Lake as our flight landed. The Wasatch Mountains actually reminded me a
little of the Oregon Cascades back home - except that they were on the wrong
side of town. 
</p>
<p class="story">
I sighed, and the exhale made room for reality to
invade. I was landing in the wrong state and still hadn't broken the news to my
husband. For once I was grateful he'd never gotten into the romantic habit of
seeing me off or picking me up at airports. 
</p>
<p class="story">
City traffic was sparse as we drove from Salt Lake City
International to the downtown FBI office to pick up the witness's address from
the local agents.
</p>
<p class="story">
In February 1987, this crucial eyewitness was simply an
unsuspecting secretary sitting at a desk shuffling papers for a small,
independent Salt Lake City computer company when out of the corner of her eye
she absentmindedly noticed a man walking outside the bank of windows that
fronted her office. She registered the image as it passed from one windowpane
to the next, but then realized that he'd not passed by the third. Thinking he
might have fallen, she stood up and looked. 
</p>
<p class="story">
What she saw was a figure hunched down by the front
driver's side of her own car, placing what appeared to be a wooden device
beneath the wheel. As she yelled out to the business owner's mother to take a
look, the stranger turned and stole a fleeting glance over his shoulder at her
from just over twenty feet away. Sunglasses concealed his eyes. He looked
immediately back toward the package, then stood up and casually walked off,
leaving the device tucked underneath her front wheel.
</p>
<p class="story">
By then, both women were at the window, though all they
could see was his back, his face hidden entirely by the hood of the gray
sweatshirt he wore on the sunny Salt Lake City winter day.
</p>
<p class="story">
Odd, she thought. I'll just move whatever that is when I
get off work. The two women laughed at the strangeness of his actions and
commented on his &quot;cute ass&quot; as he walked away. A ringing phone drew
away their attention and they returned to work.
</p>
<p class="story">
&quot;Whatever that is&quot; was shoved into a canvas
bag and appeared to be two two-by-four-inch pieces of wood held together by
long nails that protruded through the top board and into the crisp Utah air. 
</p>
<p class="story">
Within an hour, the company's owner, Gary Wright, pulled
in and parked in his assigned place several spaces away. As he passed by his
employee's car, which he knew by her customized license plates, he noticed the
package wedged near the tire. Concerned that she would run over it, he bent
over to lift it out of the way. Instead, it exploded in his hands. Gary
Wright's mother watched from just inside the office window as the blast tore
through her son's body. 
</p>
<p class="story">
Injuries from his moment of unsolicited heroism were
substantial to Wright's arms, legs, throat, face, and left hand. Years would
follow before his body would heal, and the emotional injury would be far, far
slower to mend. The mad bomber had blighted another life and left another
victim without hope of reclaiming a carefree spirit. But the bomber himself had
lost something, too: his anonymity. He'd shown his face - though only for a
second - to his first and, as it would turn out, his only eyewitness. 
</p>
<p class="story">
The FBI, deep into its Unabomber investigation by then,
identified many of the telltale fragments in the explosion remains. Their
questions had less to do with who placed the bomb than they did with why it was
placed under the car of this woman. Her custom license plates bearing her name
indicated that his selection might not be random. If they could determine a
rationale for how the Unabomber targeted his victims, they might be able to
avert the next disaster.
</p>
<p class="story">
To find their answer, the FBI seized the witness's
privacy in the name of national security. For years, agents monitored her every
movement, her contacts, friends, relatives, acquaintances, her mail, even her
phone calls. Early on, they posted lookouts around her house, all in an attempt
to answer the question &quot;Why her?&quot; Nothing about her life fit the
bomber's apparent antitechnology agenda. Yet, the debris from the blast left
unmistakable evidence that this was the work of the Unabomber. 
</p>
<p class="story">
By the time Agent Noel and I got to her home in July
1994, she simply opened the door and walked away, mumbling to the two of us,
&quot;Come on in, coffee's on,&quot; as we stood in the open doorway. For the
first order of business, I'd need to establish myself as a non-agent, almost
the &quot;anticop.&quot; Her irritation was with a system that hadn't listened
to her. As amicable as her relationship was with the agency, and especially
with Noel, I'd need to differentiate myself from &quot;them&quot; in her eyes,
so she could feel assured that 
she wasn't just repeating her past experience.</a>
</p>
<p class="story"><a name="JustWitness" href="index.html#JustWitness">
&quot;Heck, who am I? Just the
witness,&quot; she asked and answered quietly in a single breath. &quot;Never
mind what <i>I</i>  think I saw. They'll <i>tell</i>  me what I saw, and when I
tell them it's off base, they'll just tell me again. That drawing's never been
right. I've tried to tell them.&quot; She smiled shyly after her words, but her
frustration was justified, and her expectations understandably low.</A>
</p>
<p class="story">
Agent Noel knew exactly what she was talking about. He'd
heard her loud and clear over the years, but he had lacked the budget and the
nod of approval to start all over on a suspect depiction. That changed when
Attorney General Janet Reno unleashed her resources to turn over every possible
stone.</p>
<p class="story">
We started with two cups of coffee, while her
three-year-old settled comfortably into Noel's lap on the sofa, oblivious to
the weighty implications of the activity across the room.
</p>
<p class="story">
I glanced around for references from her home which
might lead me to topics that would elicit from her a positive emotional
response: photographs on shelves, book titles - I wanted to immerse her in
conversations around themes with which she was familiar and felt a sense of
mastery and control. If she focused on subjects with which she felt safe, she
might relax sufficiently for us to tap into the more sublime reservoirs of her
memory. I needed to keep her attention diverted from the task we both knew
loomed. The less she focused directly on the ominous task of re-creating the
face, the more easily the real detail would surface.
</p>
<p class="story">
Conversely, if I were to ask direct questions about the
event or even about the suspect, it could revive her emotion regarding the
bombing, and that upset could serve as an invitation for the cognitive or
conscious part of her mind - where she now held what she thought she had seen -
to take over. Cognitive recall is the portion of memory that's most susceptible
to influence and change, so what she now <i>thought</i> she had seen was most
likely to be incorrect. I had no interest in what she <i>thought</i> she saw.
We needed to reach what she had <i>actually</i> seen. By this late stage, the
two were inevitably a world apart.
</p>
<p class="story">
At her kitchen table we discussed movies, the excitement
of travel, the joys of work, and the rearing of a three-year-old, anything that
would divert her from the weight of remembering. More than anything else, I
wanted to avoid direct mention of the bombing. If we focused on the problem,
we'd fail to find the solution and could conceivably end up only with her
recall of the inaccurate sketch, which was by now securely and disastrously
embedded over the original image in her mind.
</p>
<p class="story">
The only reference to the task at hand was the infusion
every fifteen or twenty minutes of a single, quick question - always phrased in
<i>present</i> tense. &quot;Would you create a shape that's longer than wide or
the same length as width?&quot; as a simple example. Keeping the conversation
based in the present helped to anchor her emotionally in the safety of the
current moment, and to distance her from the emotions connected to her memory
of the event.
</p>
<p class="story">
I'd insert questions only when she was in a state of
relaxation. To assure that she maintained that relaxed state, I'd never refer
to the suspect or to the crime. Instead, I'd only refer to shapes and textures
in the context of an inanimate form, such as a pliable substance like clay, and
how she might shape that clay into the form of a face. 
</p>
<p class="story">
Doing so took the image of the suspect, which aroused
fear and terror in her, and transformed it into the form of a simple, harmless
object - an object that existed in the present moment and over which she could
have a feeling of control, something that the suspect, in real life, had taken
away from her.
</p>
<p class="story">
That inanimate form was lifeless, a simple imagined
shape with no personality, no eyes, no arms, <i>no bomb,</i> and therefore, of
no threat. 
</p>
<p class="story">
In every question, I monitored my voice tone so that no
descriptor would carry more gravity than any other. Eye contact during a single
question had to be completely maintained throughout or avoided altogether.
Momentary eye contact, if construed as emotional support, could lead her toward
the portion of the question during which the contact was offered. Every nuance
mattered if we were to reach the original, untainted image of the elusive
killer. 
</p>
<p class="story">
The 1987 bombing nearly caused the death of Gary Wright.
He wasn't only her employer, he was her friend. His motive in moving the
package was to help her. No matter how many years had since passed, this
witness still wrestled with intense emotional issues. Honoring and
understanding the weight of her psychological issues was the <i>most</i>
crucial step in the interview and the missing element in the traditional police
process.
</p>
<p class="story">
Agent Noel listened from across the room. The questions
were so minimal and indirect that they seemed like only momentary disruptions
in an otherwise spirited chat between two old friends. But each time, she'd
respond with answers that were crisp and precise. The distraction of our
unrelated conversation didn't leave her time to dwell or second-guess.
&quot;Second-guessing&quot; is, in fact, movement from the subliminal to the
cognitive level of memory, or - figuratively - from the heart to the brain. 
</p>
<p class="story">
As in all of life, the heart is always right. 
</p>
<p class="story">
I showed her nothing - no standard police catalogs of
facial features, no routine mug pictures, no suggestive visual aids. I asked no
leading questions to prompt her answers. Instead I relied simply on the purity
of her actual recall and the integrity of her wish to reach it. Slowly the
deeply embedded image began to emerge, making its way past the newer image by
then so ingrained in her conscious mind.
</p>
<p class="story">
In contradiction to the existent suspect drawing, no
ruddy complexion, no red hair, no blue eyes, existed or were ever seen on that
day - although they'd been mysteriously depicted to the Bureau's bewilderment
in an unsolicited drawing released by the first artist years after the bombing.
There was also definitely no thin jawline and last but not least, there was no
mustache.
</p>
<p class="story">
She talked and I listened, quietly elated, as the
answers gradually bubbled up throughout the conversation. I glanced over to
Agent Noel to watch his reactions. He looked back with his brows raised, as if
to say, &quot;Let's get to the point. What is this, the friggin' <i>Oprah
Winfrey</i> show?&quot; 
</p>
<p class="story">
It probably did look like &quot;girls' night out&quot;
to someone unfamiliar with this system of diversionary interview, but every
question was carefully timed, toned, and phrased so as not to lead her in her
answers. I wanted only the image encoded in her recall on that fateful day in
February 1987. 
</p>
<p class="story">
We <i>were</i> getting to the point. We were just taking
the back road. 
</p>
<p class="story">
The direct route, unfortunately, was covered with
debris.
</p>
<p class="story">
The eyewitness was at last content.
</p>
<p class="story">
Agent Noel and I checked into our hotel rooms and
reconvened in the lobby to go find dinner. To celebrate, we drove to Park City
in search of a place fitting the occasion. The sun had already set and Utah's
evening mountain air was sweet and sharp.
</p>
<p class="story">
We ducked into a local brewery, pulled up two pine
stools, and ordered. Max Noel was just the elixir I needed. He was one of those
animated, instantly likable men I always wished could have been my uncle or
brother or father-in-law. He talked for two hours about the devotion he felt
for his wife and the plans he had to surprise her with a cabin he'd rented for
the upcoming weekend. I watched his eyes dance when he described their
long-term, solid partnership. 
</p>
<p class="story">
&quot;So how did you ever find that, Max?&quot; I asked.
</p>
<p class="story">
&quot;I don't know,&quot; he said, looking down. Then he
let out a huff and smiled. &quot;I was just real lucky I guess.&quot; Listening
to his stories reminded me of the phone call I still had to make. 
</p>
<p class="story">
Before we said good-night, I slid the finished draft of
the new drawing out of its carrier and handed it over for his inspection. We
locked eyes in the sudden realization of what exactly we'd accomplished. 
</p>
<p class="story">
Against all odds, we held in our hands the first real
look...at the face of a madman.
</p>
<p class="story">
&quot;Hi, sweetheart. How are you?...No, I'm not at the
airport....
</p>
<p class="story">
No, I'm not in Albuquerque either, that was yesterday.
See, I got kind of, well, rerouted - by an FBI agent. I'm in Salt Lake. It
couldn't be helped. It was an important case. I'll be home tomorrow though, not
late, I promise.&quot; 
</p>
<p class="story">
Robert's exhale hurt my ear. &quot;Damn it anyway,
Jeanne. You know - they're <i>all</i> important cases, so what <i>else</i> is
new?&quot; I held the receiver away from my ear. His voice accelerated in speed
and upped in volume. I knew that tone well. I could even picture his angry
face. My elation over the day's success turned into a knot in the center of my
stomach.
</p>
<p class="story">
&quot;Look,&quot; he said, &quot;I had to fix my own
dinner tonight. Yours is sitting here cold, and you know, Jeanne - damn it
anyway - you're testing my limits! Tell me one thing, okay? Just tell me - why
can't you just be...<i>normal?&quot;</i></p>
