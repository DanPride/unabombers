<p><b><i><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>For extraordinary heroism and
conspicuous gallantry in action above and beyond the call of duty while serving
with the Second Battalion, Seventh Marines, First Marine Division, in combat
against enemy Japanese forces in the Solomon Islands Area on October 26, 1942.
When the enemy broke through the line directly in front of his position,
Platoon Sergeant Paige, commanding a machine-gun section with fearless
determination, continued to direct fire of his gunners until all of his men
were either killed or wounded. Alone, against the deadly hail of Japanese
shells, he manned his gun, and when it was destroyed, took over another, moving
from gun to gun, never ceasing his withering fire against the advancing hordes
until reinforcements finally arrived. Then, forming a new line, he dauntlessly
and aggressively led a bayonet charge, driving the enemy back and preventing a
break through in our lines. His great personal valor and unyielding devotion to
duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval
Service.</span></i></b> </p>
