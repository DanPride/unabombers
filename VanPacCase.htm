II. Factual Background
</p><br>
<p class="para">In December 1989, four mail bombs
were received at different addresses in the southeastern United States. One
bomb killed Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Robert Vance in Birmingham,
Alabama; another killed attorney Robert Robinson in Savannah, Georgia; the
third was discovered before exploding at a federal courthouse in Atlanta,
Georgia; and the fourth was discovered before exploding at the Jacksonville,
Florida office of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People (NAACP). 
</p>
<a name="VanPacBomb"></a>
<p class="para">
<a href="http://www.Unabombers.com/#Stamps">The mail
bombs had numerous similarities, which included: they were delivered in
packages wrapped in brown paper, tied with string, addressed with typed
red-and-white labels, and posted with stamps depicting an American flag over
Yosemite National Park; they were placed in cardboard boxes that had been
painted black in the inside; and each bomb included a steel pipe filled with
smokeless powder, finishing nails secured to the outside of the pipe, and a
detonator fashioned from a flashbulb filament with distinctive wiring and a
ballpoint pen casing. The detonators from the two bombs that did not explode
contained a green powder identified as high explosive primer. Three of the
bombs also had welded end plates that were joined together by a steel rod
through the center of the pipe.</a>
</p>
<p class="para">
The bombings were followed by a
large-scale investigation involving the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms (ATF), the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation,
and other law enforcement agencies. The unexploded devices found in Atlanta and
Jacksonville were sent to the FBI Laboratory for analysis in December 1989, as
was debris from the mail bombs from Savannah and Birmingham. J. Thomas Thurman
of the EU was assigned as the principal examiner.
</p>
<p class="para">
Thurman enlisted various
auxiliary examiners in other units of the Laboratory to examine evidence. The
other examiners included Roger Martz, who was then chief of the CTU. In January
1990, Martz determined that each mail bomb contained Red Dot double base
smokeless powder. He also determined that a green powder found inside the
detonators of the two unexploded mail bombs was a small arms primer
manufactured by CCI Industries.
</p>
<p class="para">
Walter LeRoy Moody, Jr. was
identified as a suspect after ATF forensic chemist Lloyd Erwin recalled that
Moody had been convicted in a 1972 case involving a pipe bomb with a design
similar to that of the 1989 bombs. In February 1990, federal investigators
searched a storage area rented by Moody in Chamblee, Georgia, and found a
device constructed from a metal pipe that was similar in some respects to the
construction of the mail bombs. Several searches of Moody's house, however,
failed to reveal evidence of Red Dot smokeless powder or the type of CCI primer
identified by Martz in the explosive devices.
</p>
<p class="para">
In April 1990, a witness named
Paul Sartain told ATF agents that while he was working at the AShootin' Iron
gun store in December 1989, he had sold someone a four pound can of Red Dot
smokeless powder and a quantity of CCI primers. Sartain later identified Moody
as the person who had purchased these items.
</p>
<p class="para">
In July 1990, Moody was indicted
on charges that he had suborned perjury by a witness in connection with a 1988
hearing on a coram nobis petition he had filed related to his 1972 conviction.
A jury convicted Moody of these charges after a trial in Brunswick, Georgia, in
December 1990.
</p>
<p class="para">
In November 1990, Moody was
charged with various federal crimes related to the bombings. Venue for trial
was transferred to St. Paul, Minnesota and the case was assigned to Senior
Judge Edward J. Devitt. After a trial in June 1991, a jury convicted Moody on
71 separate counts. The judge sentenced Moody to seven life terms plus four
hundred years.
</p>
<p class="para">
During the trial, Lloyd Erwin,
Frank Lee, and Terry Byer of the ATF testified about the construction of the
four mail bombs, the 1972 bomb, and the Chamblee device. They opined that all
had been made by the same person. Moody's former wife Susan McBride Moody
testified that she had purchased various items at Moody's direction. The items
she purchased were consistent with components used in the mail bombs. A former
cellmate of Moody's, Ted Banks, testified that at Moody's request he had welded
end plates onto three metal pipes that were similar to those used in three of
the bombs. Paul Sartain testified that in December 1989, he had sold Moody a
four-pound keg of Red Dot smokeless powder and 4,000 CCI small pistol primers.
</p>
<p class="para">
During the third week of trial,
the government presented testimony by Thurman and Martz from the FBI's
Laboratory Division. Thurman testified about the construction of the mail bombs
and opined that they had been made by the same person who made the 1972 bomb.
Martz testified that the mail bombs contained Red Dot double base smokeless
powder and that he identified CCI small arms primer in detonators from the two
unexploded devices.
