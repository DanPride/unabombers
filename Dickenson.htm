      twenty-first-century historians look back at the breakdown of the United 
      States patent system, they will see a turning point in the case of Jeff Bezos and Amazon.com and their special <I>invention</I>: "the patented 
      1-click feature," Bezos calls it.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Not everyone who knows 
      Bezos as the new-minted billionaire founder of the world's leading 
      Internet retailer knows that he's also an inventor, but he is. It says so 
      on U.S. Patent No. 5,960,411, "Method and System for Placing a Purchase 
      Order via a Communications Network." Every good invention needs a story, 
      and Jeff Bezos has one for one-click ordering. He's laying it out in 
      federal court, where already, at the height of the holiday shopping 
      season, he won an injunction forcing his chief competitor, 
      Barnesandnoble.com, to add deliberate complication to its ordering 
      process.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; In ways that could not have been predicted even a 
      few years ago, the patent system is in crisis. A series of unplanned 
      mutations have transformed patents into a positive threat to the digital 
      economy. The patent office has grown entangled in philosophical confusion 
      of its own making; it has become a ferocious generator of litigation; and 
      many technologists believe that it has begun to choke the very innovation 
      it was meant to nourish.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; The one-click story starts like 
      this: A young man founds a company called Amazon.com in the obligatory 
      garage, with a bit of money raised from his family. Soon his tiny crew 
      begins selling books on line. Their customers use a "shopping cart." Of 
      course, there isn't a real shopping cart, because the customers aren't 
      really <I>at</I> these stores, and there aren't really <I>stores</I> at 
      all. There is just a tiny picture of a shopping cart, and if you click on 
      it with the mouse, the screen displays a list of items you have selected 
      for purchase.

      online shopper is thought to possess a thoroughly modern attention span, 
      and many shopping carts are left abandoned in their virtual aisles. So 
      Bezos decides ("sometime prior to May of 1997," he says with the help of 
      his lawyers) to offer a shortcut: let users choose an item with just one 
      click of the mouse button, and use a shipping address and credit-card 
      number already on file. Obvious? Sure, but among his employees some were 
      naysayers, worried about spooking the customers. "Conventional wisdom was 
      that they had to be slowly and incrementally led to the point of 
      purchase," Bezos recalls. But his vision will not be denied. He orders his 
      software developers to "make it happen." And so they do.<BR>&nbsp; Amazon 
      applies to the government for a trademark on the name "1-Click" and a 
      patent on the . . . well, on what, exactly? Not the idea, because pure 
      abstractions may not be patented. Not the program code, because copyright 
      law protects this. But Amazon received its patent in September and 
      instantly sued Barnes and Noble over its similar "Express Lane." Amazon 
      won an injunction in December forcing its competitor to insert a 
      superfluous mouse click. ("Please be sure to click this button," Barnes 
      and Noble begs plaintively. "If you don't, we won't get your 
      order!")<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; The one-click injunction capped a burst of 
      skirmishing in 1999 รท the start of what promises to become furious, 
      wide-ranging courtroom warfare รท over who will control electronic 
      commerce. As the year 2000 begins, few of America's e-commerce leaders are 
      <I>not</I> targets of patent litigation. The battles to come will 
      determine whether the essential tools and building blocks will continue to 
      spread rapidly through the community of software designers and Internet 
      pioneers, or whether they will be cordoned off as the private property of 
      particular companies. Amazon just got a new patent for a system of letting 
      Web sites refer customers in exchange for commissions รท its "affiliate" 
      program. Sure enough, Barnes and Noble has a nearly identical affiliate 
      program. So do thousands of other online merchants, now feverishly calling 
      their lawyers yet again. Can Amazon really <I>own</I> this? For better or 
      worse, the struggle will redefine our understanding of what an invention 
      is, in our complex, technocratic age.

      <B><FONT color=green face="" size=5>P</FONT></B>atents long served as a 
      fundamental cog in the American machine, cherished in our national soul. 
      We are the land of Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers and Alexander 
      Graham Bell, where Congress is empowered by the Constitution <I><FONT 
      color=#008000>t</FONT>o promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, 
      by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right 
      to their respective Writings and Discoveries.</I> Hence the patent office, 
      charged with the enforcement of a Faustian bargain: inventors give up 
      their secrets, publishing them for all to see and absorb, and in exchange 
      they get 20-year government-sanctioned monopolies on their technologies. 
      This arrangement fueled industrial progress in the early United States by 
      encouraging investment in research and rewarding inventors who published 
      their work rather than cloaking it in trade secrets. <BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
      Now, however, during the short span of the Internet revolution, the patent 
      system has begun to disintegrate by growing out of control. The United 
      States is issuing patents at a torrential pace, establishing new records 
      each year, and it is expanding the universe of things that can be 
      patented. Patents began in a world of machines and chemical processes รท a 
      substantial, tangible, nuts-and-bolts world รท but now they have spread 
      across a crucial boundary, into the realm of thought and abstraction. 
      Software and algorithms used to be unpatentable. Recent court decisions 
      and patent-office rule-making has made software the fastest growing patent 
      category, and companies are rushing to patent the most basic methods of 
      doing business. "This is a disaster," says Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard law 
      professor and cyberspace expert. "This is a major change that occurred 
      without anybody thinking through the consequences. In my view, it is the 
      single greatest threat to innovation in cyberspace, and I'm extremely 
      skeptical that anybody's going to get it in time." <BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; The 
      litigation is spreading fast. Multi-Tech Systems has just sued the three 
      leading PC makers, Compaq, Dell and Gateway, over patents on transmitting 
      data over a communications line. A St. Louis patent broker is suing Yahoo 
      over a "method of effecting commerce in a networked computer environment 
      in a computerized system" รท that is, shopping on line. Another Internet 
      startup, Priceline.com, has patented its Internet version of an ancient 
      auction technique, the name-your-price "reverse" auction, and is suing 
      Microsoft's Expedia.com travel service. Microsoft, meanwhile, has 
      infuriated much of the Internet community by patenting a well-known "style 
      sheet" technology just as it was being adopted as standard by the World 
      Wide Web consortium.

            that the patent system has at best a mixed record.&nbsp; [<A

      Sightsound.com is suing at least one music retailer and demanding 
      royalties from others over a patent on selling audio and video recordings 
      on line. A California software company is suing eBay over database 
      technology. Two professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
      are suing the Ask Jeeves search site over two patents on handling 
      questions in natural language. A Boeing software engineer has patented a 
      basic method of correcting the century in dates stored in databases and 
      sent a threatening form letter to 700 of the nation's largest 
      corporations, demanding one-fourth of a percent of their total revenues, 
      on the assumption that they probably used the same method [see <A 
      href="javascript:popUp2()">sidebar</A>].<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;This is just the 
      beginning. Patents marking off broad swaths of electronic commerce will 
      soon be pouring from the patent office, unwelcome surprises to whole 
      categories of new entrepreneurs. In the last few months, companies have 
      gotten patents for keeping calendars on the World Wide Web, for 
      downloading Web pages at regular intervals, for storing documents in 
      databases, for "real-time shopping," for auctioning cars, for creating 
      profiles of users; for search engines, for payment systems, and for 
      variations of every other fundamental gear and lever in the theoretical 
      machinery of on-line business. Just as insidiously, biotech companies are 
      getting thousands of patents granting them rights to exploit particular 
      pieces of the human genome รท the DNA common to all of us.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
      For that matter, the most trivial slices of off-line life are winning 
      patent protection: for example, <A 
      href="http://www.patents.ibm.com/details?&amp;pn=US05965809__">measuring 
      breasts with a tape to determine bra size</A>; and <A 
      href="http://www.patents.ibm.com/details?&amp;pn=US05993336__">executing a 
      tennis stroke while wearing a knee pad</A> (U.S. 5,993,336: "The tennis 
      racket is swung toward a tennis ball so as to hit the tennis ball with the 
      racket . . .") Many of these patents are harmless. Most are narrower, when 
      read carefully, than they sound at first. Others are multimillion-dollar 
      lawsuits in embryo. Every week, hundreds of new data-processing patents 
      are issued, and if you are an entrepreneur with an e-commerce business 
      plan, you will soon be cross-checking it against these patents. Won't you 
      be using a "metering mechanism for distribution of electronic 
      information"? (Intel owns it.) "Tracking the purchase of a product and 
      services over the Internet"? (InfoSpace.com.) A "method and system for 
      constructing queries"? (Microsoft.) "Expanding web documents by merging 
      with linked documents"? (IBM.)<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; Each of these patents is a 
      tiny masterpiece of logic and disputation. Each represents, by definition, 
      a restraint on trade, a layer of regulation, expensive overhead in the 
      free-market economy. The exclusive rights conveyed by a patent 
      automatically translate into higher prices for consumers somewhere along 
      the chain. The Supreme Court saw the downside more than a hundred years 
      ago. "It creates a class of speculative schemers who make it their 
      business to watch the advancing wave of improvement, and gather its foam 
      in the form of patented monopolies, which enable them to lay a heavy tax 
      upon the industry of the country," the Court wrote. "It embarrasses the 
      honest pursuit of business." Patent lawyers and officials argue that each 
      patent represents a good idea and that good ideas deserve to be rewarded; 
      but does every good idea deserve a twenty-year government-sponsored 
      monopoly?<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;"We like to say right to exploit," the 
      Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, Q. Todd Dickinson, says 
cheerfully.
