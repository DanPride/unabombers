      <DIV align=center><STRONG>Gordon Thomas - Globe-Intel 23 August, 
      2002</STRONG></DIV><BR><I>The following report may be more than a year 
      old, and and refer to an event fifty years ago, but it throws interesting 
      new light current affairs. Largely ignored by the mainstream media, what 
      follows explores the murky past of two key members of the Bush 
      administration, Cheney and Rumsfeld. Ed.</I> <BR><BR>Secret documents have 
      revealed that Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald 
      Rumsfeld are "linked to the murder" of a former senior CIA scientist. 
      <BR><BR>In 1953 Frank Olson, who was a key member of the CIAs secret 
      brainwashing programme MK-ULTRA, was sent plunging from a New York hotel 
      window. <BR><BR>He had threatened to reveal the CIA involvement in 
      "terminal experiments" in post-war Germany and in Korea during the Korean 
      War. <BR><BR>For almost half a century his son, Eric, a psychologist, has 
      insisted his father was murdered "on orders from the highest level". 
      <BR><BR>Now a California history professor, Kathryn Olmstead, revealed she 
      had discovered at the Gerald Ford library documents written by Cheney and 
      Rumsfeld at the time of Frank Olsonâs death. <BR><BR>They show how far the 
      White House went to conceal information about Olsonâs death - and his role 
      in preparing anthrax and other biological weapons. Part of his work had 
      been at Britainâs Porton Down Chemical-Bio Research Centre. <BR><BR>Cheney 
      and Rumsfeld were given the task of covering up the details of Frank 
      Olsonâs death. At the time, Rumsfeld was White House Chief of Staff to 
      President Gerald Ford. Dick Cheney was a senior White House assistant. 
      <BR><BR>The documents uncovered by Professor Olmstead include one that 
      states "Dr Olsonâs job was so sensitive that it is highly unlikely that we 
      would submit relevant evidence". <BR><BR>In another memo, Cheney 
      acknowledges that "the Olson lawyers will seek to explore all the 
      circumstances of Dr Olsonâs employment, as well as those concerning his 
      death. In any trial, it may become apparent that we are concealing 
      evidence for national security reasons and any settlement or judgement 
      reached thereafter could be perceived as money paid to cover up the 
      activities of the CIA". <BR><BR>Frank Olsonâs family received US $750,000 
      to settle their claims against the US government. <BR><BR>But Professor 
      Olmsteadâs revelations will almost certainly bring further embarrassment 
      to Rumsfeld and Cheney as the persistent fallout from the FBIs 
      investigation into the anthrax mailings last year, which lead to five 
      deaths in America, continues to escalate. <BR><BR>Both the offices of 
      Rumsfeld and Cheney have declined comment on their role in the murder of 
      Frank Olson. <BR><BR>But from his home outside Washington, Eric Olson said 
      that the documents involving Rumsfeld and Cheney show they "have questions 
      to answer". <BR><BR>He added: "The documents show the lengths to which the 
      government was trying to cover up the truth. For decades there was a cover 
      up. And then, under the guise of revealing everything, there was a new 
      cover up." <BR><BR>But a CIA spokesman, Paul Nowack, insisted that the CIA 
      had "fully cooperated in allowing the full truth to surface. Tens of 
      thousands of documents were released". <BR><BR>Eric Olson has contended 
      that his father was murdered to cover up his ultra-secret research in 
      Korea and later in Europe and Britain. <BR><BR>"My father was among 
      scientists studying the use of LSD and other drugs to enhance 
      interrogations, as Cold War tensions ran high, and Americans feared that 
      captured soldiers had been brainwashed in Korea. My father had gone to 
      Europe, where he observed the interrogation of former Nazis and Soviet 
      citizens at a secret US base", said Eric Olson. <BR><BR>He contends that 
      in the final days of his life, his father became "morally distraught" over 
      his work and decided to quit. Records show that CIA officials were 
      concerned that he was a security risk. Eric Olson believes that the 
      thought of Frank Olson quitting was a motive for the government to want 
      him dead. <BR><BR>"In 1993, Eric Olson arranged for his father's body to 
      be unearthed and examined by a forensic scientist, James Starrs. Starrs 
      concluded that Frank Olson had probably been struck on the head and then 
      thrown out of the hotel window," writes Frederick Tulsky in the Mercury 
      News. <BR><BR>Starrs' conclusion is one of the tantalizing pieces that 
      Eric Olson has gathered to support his belief that his father was 
      murdered. <BR><BR>In late November 1953, Frank Olson, then 43, joined a 
      group of government officials at a conference at Deep Creek Lodge in 
      western Maryland. For days afterward, Olson was withdrawn. His son, Eric, 
      says his father told his wife that he intended to quit his job. 
      <BR><BR>But Frank Olson did not quit. And on November 23 he went to New 
      York with another government official, where he twice visited Harold A 
      Abramson, a doctor who was one of the first researchers to study the 
      effects of LSD. <BR><BR>Olson returned to Washington, then went back to 
      New York on November 28 and checked into the Statler Hotel. He was 
      scheduled to enter a sanitarium the next day. <BR><BR>But early in the 
      morning of November 29, Frank Olson went through the window of the hotel 
      room he was sharing with a colleague, Robert Lashbrook. Lashbrook told 
      police that he was awakened by the sound of breaking glass. <BR><BR>"The 
      Olson family knew little else. But in 1975, a commission headed by Vice 
      President Nelson Rockefeller issued a report on CIA abuses, and an account 
      in the Washington Post included a mention of an Army scientist who jumped 
      from a New York hotel room days after being slipped LSD in 1953," writes 
      Tulsky. <BR><BR>"We realized they were talking about my father,'' Eric 
      Olson recalled. Family members talked to reporters about their outrage and 
      said they would sue the government. Days later, the family was invited to 
      the White House to meet President Ford. He assured them that they would be 
      given all information about what happened to Frank Olson. <BR><BR>Soon 
      after, family members were invited to lunch with CIA Director William 
      Colby, who gave them a file of documents that amounted to the CIA 
      investigation into Olson's death. But the documents left many questions 
      unanswered about both his work and the circumstances of his death. 
      <BR><BR>"The express understanding was that the government had promised to 
      give us all information, which clearly meant information about his work 
      relationship with the CIA,'' the Olsons' attorney, David Rudovsky of 
      Philadelphia, said this week. "It now appears that was not the case.'' 
      <BR><BR>Over the years Eric Olson turned up many clues, real or 
      coincidental. There was, for example, the assassination manual that the 
      CIA declassified in connection with its Guatemala activities. The manual, 
      created in the early 1950s, identified "the contrived accident'' as "the 
      most effective technique'' of secret assassination. <BR><BR>"The most 
      efficient accident, in simple assassination, is a fall of 75 feet or more 
      onto a hard surface,'' the manual stated. "It was exactly what happened to 
      my father," said Eric Olson. <BR><BR><I>Courtesy Malcolm and Indy
