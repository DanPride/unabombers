<h1 align="center">A classic example of Noam Chomsky's unique language construct in Mind Control</h1><br>
<p class= lead align="center">Its actually Un<B>a</B>bomber not Un<B>i</B>bomber. Un<B>a</B>bomber is a
serious case, Un<B>i</B>bomber is the only multiple murder
people are comfortable to laugh about. Funny but I can
tell how you think about the case by how you spell it
! Welcome to the world of public mind control.
Everybody used to spell the case Un<B>a</B>bomber until the
trial, then within a few weeks the spelling changed.
You see Un<B>a</B>bomber is a big scary thing - Listen - Pay
attention - Dangerous- Vote a bigger budget. But then
when you arrest the Patsy and have to explain the lack
of evidence (The logs were generated in the FBI Lab
according to Frederick Whitehurst) you shift the
spelling by the general public to Un<B>i</B>bomber - 
Like Un<B>i</B>corn, Un<B>i</B>sex, Un<B>i</B>Cycle, Un<B>i</B>wierd this or that. STOP
THINKING - STRANGE - FUNNY- HUMILIATING - AVOID - STOP THINKING. 
And magically at that point
everyone stopped critically analyzing the case. They
all remembered that he fertilized his veggies with his
own poop - They forgot he was in MK-Ultra (CIA
Mind Control program) starting in <a href="MKUltraInvoices.htm#Patents">1959 at Harvard</a>. 
As a 16 year old fresh Freshman prospect he rang their bells so loud they code 
named him &quot;Lawful&quot; ...the mind control equivalent of Eureka! They
all remembered he couldn't get a date, They all forgot
he deposited money into his bank 
<a href="News/97-11-11-USA-Graysmith-1.htm#BankDeposit">in Helena TWO HOURS
after</a> the Un<B>a</B>bomber <b>placed</b> a bomb in a parking lot in
Sacramento California. Fight the humor, fight the tendency <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in</span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">your</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">mind</span> for you to instantly consider any fact about the
case absolutely ridiculous - take your mind back and seriously
evaluate this- THEY use humor and ridicule when THEY
are really worried about something - when THEY really
screw-up and leave evidence all over the place. THEY
did it with Kennedy, THEY are doing it again with
Un<B>a</B>bomber, and doing it times TEN. Take a good look -
It will start your true understanding of the world you
are living in.

<p class="story"><b>Una - of singular importance</b></p>

<p class="detail">The Mind Control Spelling Test is a 
cute and disarming name for a mechanism to highlight the emotional tones which 
have been subliminally attached to two slightly different spellings of the most 
publicized terrorist case of the twentieth century. One Una =Think about this, 
its dangerous, and vote a bigger budget. The other Uni = Do not think about 
this, its weird and humiliating.
Una came BEFORE the arrest, Uni came AFTER the arrest. Uni arrived magically 
when the trial evidence became a REAL problem. Serious thought and evaluation 
ended with the spelling change.</p>
<br>
<p class="detail">There are 216 spellings for Una--- none of them sound like 
Una-something. You can not name a Una-something. There are 248 spellings for Uni--- 
many of which sound like 
Uni-something. UniSex, UniCycle, UniCorn, Uniwierd-Something-Or-Other. It is what 
Chomsky would call a unique language construct in the English Language, it is 
linguistically highly unusual.</p>
<br>
<p class="detail">Un<B>a</B>bomber is a made-up 
word. The fact that no comparable linguistic construction exists for Una 
where many exist for Uni makes the inducement of a 
switch in spelling easy and natural. The emotional 
valences to be attached to the spelling are then 
naturally reinforced by the multiple existing 
uni-absurd definitions. The purpose of the emotional valences to be attached is 
obvious. To create avoidance of ridicule reaction in the public and effectively 
end all debate at the moment &quot;THEY&quot; decide to terminate public thought and 
interaction with the case. An &quot;off&quot; switch if you will. Impressive.</p><br>
