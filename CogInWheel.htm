as the reluctant witness in the unabomber case.</p><br>
<p class="story align="center">The phrase Michael Hren is struggling to repeat is from the 
second paragraph of the Manifesto. He only got through the first page before I 
interrupted him to try and find the Kill sentence to show him in the moments 
before Dettling walked into the room. The sentence is an interesting one for him 
to remember. In addition to his role managing plastics design and the Model 
Shop, Michael ran the Corporate parties at Apple, a venerated social 
tradition at Apple of the elite. I wonder did he remember the sentence &quot;reducing 
human beings to mere cogs in the social machine&quot; because he disagreed or because 
he agreed from his unique perspective in corporate America :).</p><br>
<p class="detail">2. The industrial-technological system may survive or it
may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve 
a low level of physical and psychological sutfering, but
only after passing through a long and very painful period
of adjustment and <a href="http://www.Unabombers.com/#Manifesto">
only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to
engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine.</A>
Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences
will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or
modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving
people of dignity and autonomy.
