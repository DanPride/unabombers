Bombs fuel race hate

<strong>BODY:</strong><p class="subheader" align="Left"> 
<br>IT WAS an ordinary Christmas parcel, tied up with string and delivered in the 
Saturday afternoon post to the home of 
<strong>Robert Vance,</strong> an appeals court judge.
<br><br>Vance, a political moderate who judged dog shows in his spare time, had every 
reason to believe it was an innocent holiday gift; it appeared to come from 
Judge Lewis Morgan, an elderly member of the same court, who once sent him a 
package of magazines about horse breeding.
<br><br>But the parcel contained a metal pipe packed with explosives and wrapped in 
nails. It blew up as Vance began unwrapping it in the kitchen of his home in 
Birmingham, Alabama.  

<br><br>The murder was the opening round in a bombing campaign that is stirring the 
ghost of racial hatred in what is supposed to be the ''new'' American South.
<br><br>Two days after Vance died, a package was delivered by post at the office of 
Robert Robinson, a black city councillor in Savannah, Georgia. Robinson died in 
hospital a few hours later. The authorities then discovered two identical 
bombs, unexploded, which had been delivered to a Florida office of the National 
Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and to the Atlanta 
courthouse where Vance worked.
<br><br>The bombings are causing uproar across the heart of the old Confederacy. 
Maynard Jackson, mayor of Atlanta, pleaded for new laws to combat racial 
violence.
<br><br>Responsibility for the attacks was claimed by the previously unheard-of 
''Americans for a Competent Federal Judicial System''. In a 
letter to an Atlanta television station last week, the group issued a warning 
that two more black civil rights workers would be killed. The letter also said 
that one judge, one lawyer and one civil rights worker would be killed ''any 
time a black man rapes a white woman'' in the states of Alabama, Georgia and 
Florida.
<br><br>The letter, which the FBI is convinced was sent by the bombers, accused the 
Eleventh Circuit, a regional appeals court, of coddling black rapists.
<br><br>Sources close to the Treasury Department, which specialises in investigating 
crimes involving explosives, say it suspects the bombings were the work of a 
splinter group of a neo-Nazi movement based in Idaho, in the northwest.
<br><br>The FBI is doubtful about this connection, however. It has established that the 
typewriter used to address the 
bombs was also used to write an anonymous ''Declaration of War'' sent to newspapers last summer. It criticised the Eleventh 
Circuit court and threatened poison gas attacks on cities. But William Hinshaw, 
of the FBI's Atlanta office, said: ''We are looking at the possibility that 
this is a case of one person who's not affiliated with any group. We don't 
really understand how this person thinks.''
