<strong>BODY:</strong><p class="subheader" align="Left"> 
<br>BRUNSWICK, Ga. - Walter Leroy Moody, convicted of two fatal mail&#160;bombings in June, was sentenced Wednesday to 15 years in prison and fined&#160;$ 400,000 for bribing witnesses, conspiracy and obstruction of justice in&#160;an effort to have a a 1972 
Bomb possession conviction overturned.
<br><br>Testimony at Moody's trial indicated he created an elaborate alibi,&#160;invented a suspect and paid or threatened witnesses in an attempt to&#160;clear himself of charges that he built a 
Bomb that injured his first&#160;wife, Hazel. He was convicted on 13 counts and could have been sentenced&#160;to 70 years in prison and fined more than $ 2 million.  

<br><br>That 
Bomb eventually led federal authorities to Moody in the 1989&#160;mail bombings that killed 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge 
<strong>Robert&#160;Vance</strong> of Alabama and a Savannah lawyer, Robert Robinson. He was convicted&#160;in those deaths in June in Minneapolis and could receive multiple life&#160;terms without parole when he is sentenced Aug. 20.
<br><br>Before U.S. District Judge Anthony A. Alaimo passed sentence&#160;Wednesday, Moody, 57, made a brief statement, saying his second wife,&#160;Susan McBride, who testified against him, was blameless.
<br><br>&quot;The culpability in regard to this matter lies with me in its&#160;entirety,&quot; Moody said. 
&quot;Susan's participation was unwilling and the&#160;result of psychological coercion from me.&quot;
<br><br>He asked the court to direct any sentence intended for Ms. McBride&#160;to him instead.
<br><br>&quot;That's the first admirable thing I've heard you say,&quot; Judge Alaimo&#160;responded.
<br><br>Moody's attorney, Edward Tolley, attempted to use an insanity&#160;defense for Moody in the Brunswick case, but Moody rejected his&#160;attorney's advice.
<br><br>Mr. Tolley said that he plans to appeal the sentence and that no&#160;decision has been made on whether Moody will be prosecuted on state&#160;murder charges in Alabama and Georgia.
<br><br>Chatham County District Attorney Spencer Lawton has said he wants to&#160;prosecute Moody and ask for the death penalty in Mr. Robinson's murder.
<br><br>Ms. McBride, who was divorced from Moody before his mail-bombing&#160;trial and has since remarried, is to be sentenced next week in Brunswick&#160;on one conspiracy count.
