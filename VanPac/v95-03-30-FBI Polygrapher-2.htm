<p class="subheader" align="Left">A federal judge indicated Wednesday he probably will toss out Walter Leroy 
Moody's motion for a new trial, saying he found much of a key witness' 
testimony 
&quot;unbelievable.&quot; 

<br><br>U.S. District Judge Thomas Flannery said he saw no evidence that FBI agents 
coerced Ted Banks into testifying in the 1991 trial in which Moody was 
convicted of mailing pipe 
bombs that killed a federal judge and a Savannah civil rights lawyer. 

<br><br>On Tuesday, Banks testified that FBI agents threatened him to force him to lie 
to convict Moody during the 1991 trial.  

<br><br>Flannery, a Washington, D.C., judge brought in to hear the motion, said he will 
issue a formal ruling in a few weeks. He said he found Moody's claims of 
government misconduct and newly discovered evidence 
&quot;without merit.&quot; 

<br><br>Flannery's comments capped a two-day hearing during which Moody refused to 
present any evidence on his behalf or question any of the witnesses. 

<br><br>A prosecution witness, FBI Special Agent Raymond Raleigh, on Wednesday directly 
implicated Banks, 68, a boat maker from Titusville, Fla., in the mail-Bomb attacks. 

<br><br>Banks testified at the trial that he welded three pipes together at Moody's 
request in 1989 and suspected they were for 
bombs. One was made into the 
Bomb that killed Savannah lawyer Robert Robinson. The other two were made into mail 
bombs and 
intercepted at the NAACP office in Jacksonville and at the 11th U.S. Circuit 
Court of Appeals. 

<br><br>Another pipe, not welded by Banks, contained the mail 
Bomb from Moody that killed federal Judge 
<strong>Robert Vance</strong> of Alabama. 

<br><br>Raleigh, an FBI polygrapher, said he tested Banks twice in January 1991, asking 
Banks if he helped plan any of the bombings, if he helped make the 
bombs, and if he helped select any of the victims. When Banks replied, 
&quot;no&quot; to the questions, the polygraph indicated deception, Raleigh said.
