<strong>BODY:</strong><p class="subheader" align="Left"> 
<br>An 11-month investigation of the mail 
Bomb killings of a Federal judge and a civil rights lawyer has stalled over efforts 
by prosecutors to disqualify the suspect's court-appointed lawyer. 

<br><br>Federal prosecutors notified a Federal magistrate on Tuesday that they would 
file a motion this week seeking to disqualify the lawyer, Bruce Harvey.
<br><br>The move could delay the trial of Walter Leroy Moody Jr. He was accused in a 
70-count Federal indictment, handed down last week, of sending parcel 
bombs that killed Judge 
<strong>Robert Vance</strong> of the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Alabama, and 
Robert Robinson, a lawyer, in Savannah.
<br><br>The 
bombs were sent over a three-day period in December 1989. 

<br><br>Howard Shapiro, a Special Assistant United States Attorney, gave 
no reason for seeking to remove Mr. Harvey, but he said Tuesday that it 
&quot;will all be quite clear in whatever motion we file.&quot;
<br><br>Michael Hauptman, a lawyer who is assisting Mr. Harvey in the case, said he 
expects that the Government will base its disqualification argument on the 
possibility that Mr. Harvey might be called as a witness in the trial.
<br><br>Mr. Harvey could not be reached for comment.
<br><br>Mr. Moody, from Rex. Ga., is to be tried in Brunswick later this month on 
charges of witness tampering and obstruction of justice in connection with a 
1972 conviction for possessing a pipe 
bomb.
<br><br>Mr. Moody's defense team, led by Mr. Harvey, filed a motion last Thursday 
seeking to bar all Federal judges from hearing the case. The Government has not 
yet 
filed a response.
