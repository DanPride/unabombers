Officials at the State Crime Lab were analyzing a package containing a 
flammable substance found outside the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals today.
<br><br>The liquid, found in a metal container in an alley behind the courthouse, could 
not immediately be identified by Atlanta police who were called to the scene 
about 5 a.m. The Atlanta SWAT team was trying to determine if it had been put 
there deliberately.  

<br><br>Security has been tight at the courthouse since a package 
Bomb was found there in December 1989, just days after one of the court's judges 
was killed by a 
Bomb mailed to his home in Alabama.
<br><br>Walter Leroy Moody Jr. of Rex was convicted of federal charges in connection 
with the death of Judge 
<strong>Robert Vance</strong> and the similar slaying of a Savannah lawyer and alderman, Robert Robinson.
<br><br>Moody now faces a capital murder charge in Alabama.
