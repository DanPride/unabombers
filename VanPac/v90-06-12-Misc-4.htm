<strong>BODY:</strong><p class="subheader" align="Left"> 
<br>Federal agents investigating a rash of bombings in the Southeast last December 
said today that they hoped the arrest on other charges of a man who was the 
focus of their investigation would eventually strengthen the bombing case.
<br><br>The man, Walter Leroy Moody Jr., was indicted Tuesday on charges of perjury and 
obstruction of justice in a case of 
Bomb possession dating to 1972.
<br><br>Earlier this year, Federal officials began investigating Mr. Moody in 
connection with the bombing deaths of Judge 
<strong>Robert Vance,</strong> of the Federal appeals court, in Mountain Brook, Ala., and Robert Robinson, a 
lawyer in Savannah, Ga.  

<br><br>Agents have said Mr. Moody is ''the focus'' of their investigation into the 
bombings.
<br><br>Mr. Moody's lawyer, Bruce Harvey, today called Tuesday's indictment of his 
client the investigators' ''consolation prize'' from their six months of 
intensive, but so far inconclusive, focus on his client.
<br><br>''This has nothing to do with the bombing investigation,'' Mr. Harvey said. 
''This has been a six-month intensive investigation by at least six agencies of 
the Federal Government. They have issued at least nine search warrants aimed at 
my client, and President Bush has said that this is a priority case, and what 
they come up with is not an indictment in the mail bombing case. Well, I call 
this charge a consolation prize.''
<br>&#160;
<br>Move Could Draw Witnesses 

<br><br>Investigators in the case, who spoke on the condition that their names not be 
used, said today that they hoped the arrest and detention of Mr. Moody would 
prompt witnesses in the bombing case to come forward.
<br><br>Sam Wilson, the Assistant United States Attorney for the Middle District of 
Georgia, who is prosecuting the perjury and obstruction of justice case, has 
asked that Mr. Moody be held without bond under provisions of Federal law that 
permit pretrial detention of anyone considered a threat to potential witnesses 
or jurors. A hearing will be held Thursday on his request.
<br><br>Investigators working on the bombing case say that in their opinion Mr. Moody 
is capable of intimidating potential witnesses.
<br><br>Mr. Wilson would not comment on whether the case was connected to the 
continuing investigations into the bombings last year.
<br><br>But as Mr. Moody was being arraigned Tuesday in Macon, seated at the table with 
Mr. Wilson was Louis Freeh, who was appointed in May to be special prosecutor 
in the bombing investigation.
<br><br>The 
perjury case grew out of appeals that Mr. Moody, a 56-year-old freelance 
literary consultant, filed for a 1972 conviction for 
Bomb possession.
<br><br>Mr. Moody, who lives in Rex, Ga., was indicted with his wife, Susan, on 13 
counts of perjury, bribery, obstruction of justice and tampering with a witness.
<br>&#160;
<br>Indictment Relates to Testimony 

<br><br>The indictment charges that in the most recent of many appeals by Mr. Moody, he 
and his wife engaged in a scheme to place responsibility for the 
Bomb on someone else and enlisted an Atlanta woman and her mother to give false 
testimony in a 1986 hearing.
<br><br>The women are cooperating with prosecutors, and, last April, were placed in a 
witness protection program after they expressed concerns about their safety.
<br><br>Jack Killorin, a spokesman for the 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, which is part of the Federal task 
force working on the bombing case, said that the current charges, quite apart 
from any connection with the bombing investigation, were ''serious allegations 
which stand on their own.''
<br><br>If convicted on all the charges, Mr. Moody faces as many as 69 years in prison, 
and his wife as many as 64. Each could be fined $1.2 million.
