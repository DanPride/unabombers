<br>Civil-rights leaders are breathing easier with theyesterday of a Georgia man in 
a series of mail bombings that killed a federal judge and an NAACP lawyer and 
put the South on edge just before Christmas last year. 

<br><br>The indictment also accuses Walter Leroy Moody Jr., a 56-year-old self-employed 
editor, of sending racist and threatening letters. 

<br><br>He is to be arraigned in federal court today.  

<br><br>The bombings and threats spread a wave of pre-Christmas terror that had 
lawyers, judges and civil-rights officials contacting authorities when they 
received unexpected packages. 

<br><br>&quot;We are relieved that federal authorities believe that a suspected perpetrator 
has been identified, and cautious that no other persons are or may be 
implicated,&quot; said Earl Shinhoster, Southeast director of the National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People. 

<br><br>He said the bombings 
&quot;created a climate of uneasy apprehension for many of us in the civil-rights 
community that will not be easily abated even with the indictments.&quot; 

<br><br>Moody, for months a leading suspect in the case, was charged in the killing of 
appeals Judge 
<strong>Robert Vance</strong> of Mountainbrook, Ala., on Dec. 16, 1989, and the slaying of civil-rights 
lawyer Robert Robinson of Savannah, Ga., two days later. 

<br><br>The nail-packed 
bombs bore marked 
similarities to one that Moody was convicted of possessing in 1972, federal 
authorities said.  They said all three 
bombs were built by a method not used in any of more than 10,000 
bombs they had examined over the years. 

<br><br>The indictment also accuses Moody of sending 
bombs to the 11th U.S. Circuit courthouse in Atlanta -- Vance was a member of the 
11th Circuit -- and to the NAACP in Jacksonville, Fla. Those two 
bombs were safely defused. 

<br><br>In addition, Moody was charged with sending dozens of threatening letters to 
NAACP officials, lawyers, judges and TV stations, and with sending a tear-gas 
Bomb that went off at the NAACP's Atlanta office. 

<br><br>U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh and FBI Director William Sessions, who 
announced the indictment in Washington, said authorities believe Moody acted 
alone.  been speculated that racism or revenge 
against the judicial system prompted the attacks. Moody is white, as was Vance. 
 Robinson, a Savannah city alderman who did legal work for the NAACP, was 
black.
