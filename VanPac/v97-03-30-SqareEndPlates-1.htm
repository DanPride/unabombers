Surrounded by shelves of dusty chemistry books and brown jars of chemicals,
Richard Strobel resembles a high school science teacher at work in a cluttered
science lab. <br>
<br>
But Strobel, a forensic expert for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,
is no ordinary scientist, and his workplace in suburban Washington is no
run-of-the-mill laboratory. <br>
<br>
Strewn atop the counters are jagged bits and pieces of some of the nation's
most deadly bombs. <br>
<br>
Pipe Bomb pieces that killed a Milwaukee paperboy have been
partially reassembled. Evidence collected from a man suspected of nearly
killing a Rochester, N.Y., girl with a package Bomb are zipped
up in a plastic bag waiting for analysis. <br>
<br>
Blasting caps, timers and remote control detonators of all shapes and sizes are
scattered about in cardboard boxes. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&quot;There isn't too much we haven't seen,&quot; says Strobel. <br>
Bombings in the news <br>
<br>
Strobel and his colleagues have worked on some of the country's highest-profile
investigations: the World Trade Center bombing, the Oklahoma City bombing and
the still unexplained explosion aboard TWA flight 800 in July. <br>
<br>
Pieces of the recent bombs that exploded at a Sandy Springs
abortion clinic and a lesbian nightclub in Atlanta have also been examined
here, although most of the forensic work on those cases is being conducted in
the ATF's explosives lab in Atlanta. <br>
<br>
Together with a third explosives lab in California, ATF Bomb
specialists opened nearly 3,300 new arson and explosives investigations last
year. <br>
<br>
&quot;We do more bombing investigations and examination of evidence than
anyone,&quot; says ATF assistant director Patrick Hynes. &quot;It's something
that we do better than anyone else.&quot; <br>
<br>
The ATF has long been considered the authority on arson investigations. The
agency helped solve one-third of the church burnings that swept the South in
the past two years, twice the average clearance rate for arson cases. <br>
<br>
In the past 20 years, the ATF has played a leading role in developing
techniques to secure Bomb scenes and collect evidence. <br>
<br>
ATF explosives experts have been called in to help local law enforcement
officials in about a dozen foreign countries. <br>
<br>
The bureau's newest initiative is to create a clearinghouse of all bombing and
arson cases nationwide, a computerized data base that will allow investigators
to match similar crimes. <br>
<br>
The ATF's forensic work in explosives cases has earned the grudging respect of
the FBI, whose crime lab handles bombings involving international terrorism. <br>
<br>
&quot;Overall, they have done a good job,&quot; said Bob Quigley, the chief of
the FBI's Bomb data center from 1983 to 1990. &quot;The
biggest problem is that they are not a solid investigative agency . . .They
don't have the network that the FBI has established over 90 years.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;ATF's experience and accomplishments in the areas of arson and explosives
is well-documented,&quot; counters Hynes. &quot;They speak for
themselves.&quot; <br>
<br>
Bomb forensics is painstaking work. As late as the 1960s,
Strobel says, forensic experts believed that bombs left no
evidence, that fingerprints and other identifying evidence were literally
destroyed in the explosion. <br>
<br>
Forensic experts now realize that all bombs leave evidence.
The trick is recognizing the pieces, putting them back together and then
analyzing them for clues. <br>
<br>
&quot;How parts were blown up can determine if the pieces were part of the
device or not,&quot; Strobel explains. <br>
<br>
Bomb squads in the ATF's 22 regional offices, called national
response teams, are the first to respond to a suspected bombing. <br>
<br>
The teams secure the area and comb the ground for pieces of the device, putting
evidence in empty paint cans. Agents are trained to distinguish Bomb
parts in the chaotic aftermath of an explosion by looking for telltale markings
created by intense heat and explosive force. <br>
<br>
An ATF agent, for example, quickly identified the axle of the truck containing
the World Trade Center Bomb in 1993, leading investigators
directly to the car rental agency that leased the truck to the bombers. <br>
<br>
Once collected, Bomb parts end up at one of the ATF's three
explosives labs. In the lab here, Strobel and his colleagues can analyze the <strong>bomb's</strong>
explosive residue, determining the type and strength of explosive powder. <br>
<br>
They will examine the pieces for latent fingerprints and markings left by the Bomb
maker's tools. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&quot;We look for the tiniest of clues,&quot; Strobel says. <br>
Similarities provide clues <br>
<br>
In reality, investigators depend as much on the human nature of the bomber as
they do on the physical evidence he or she leaves behind. <br>
<br>
Like most people, bombers tend to be creatures of habit. They make their bombs
the same way, using similar components. <br>
<br>
It was force of habit that led an ATF forensic scientist in Atlanta to
recognize the work of convicted mail bomber Walter Leroy Moody, who killed a
Savannah civil rights lawyer and an Alabama federal judge. <br>
<br><a name="Stamps">
Lloyd Erwin, who is now one of the lead forensic experts assigned to the
abortion clinic and nightclub bombings in Atlanta, worked on a package Bomb
that Moody sent in 1972, injuring a young woman. <br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.unabombers.com/#Stamps2">The 1972 bomb used 
square end plates fastened together
with a rod down the middle of the pipe, similar to the bombs used against Judge Robert
Vance and Savannah lawyer Robbie Robinson 17 years later.</a><br>
<br>
Erwin spotted the similarities and was the first to tip authorities to Moody,
who was sentenced to death in Alabama last month for Vance's death. <br>
<br>
&quot;What propels us in these cases is thinking about the victims,&quot;
Strobel says. &quot;That's what really gets under your skin and drives
you.&quot; <br>
