<br>When word came last Saturday that Bob Vance -- U.S. District Judge 

<strong>Robert Vance</strong> of Birmingham -- had been assassinated by a letter 

<strong>bomb,</strong> the first reaction was shock. Now, at the end of the 1980s? After so long? He 

had survived the 1960s, when his willingness to do public battle for political 

and social decency in Alabama had made him, along with so many of his fellow 

Alabamans who were black, and so few of his fellow whites, a marked man. He had 

survived, then overcome, and, in his appointment as federal judge 10 years ago, 

prevailed. A man who loved his nation, its Constitution and the promises it 

made to all its citizens had become the embodiment of all three.

<br><br>First shock, then abiding grief, then outrage as it became increasingly clear 

that Bob's murder was racially motivated. The subsequent letter-Bomb killing of Robert Robinson, the black Savannah alderman and 

civil rights lawyer, made that conclusion almost inescapable. Two good men had 

been brought down by an reverberating echo from days we had hoped were gone 

forever.  



<br><br>For a long time in our region death was in the air, a palpable thing, a 

possibility if not a probability for people you knew and people you didn't 

know, friends and strangers doing what you were doing across the South. 

Race-related murder was almost commonplace. 

Bombs killed little children and old men. Mobs of angry men and lone gunmen inflamed 

by hate and condoned by the silence of the society around them killed 

housewives and seminarians, retired postmen and mentally retarded handymen. 

Those who represented the forces of local law and order, those who spoke as the 

elected representatives of the people in most of the states of the South, 

either averted their gaze or tried to justify the unconscionable.

<br><br>And then it changed, changed because Southern blacks put their lives on line to 

force change, changed because the federal government finally threw itself 

behind 

change, changed because a growing number of South ern whites decided that 

&quot;our way of life&quot; was an affront to the teachings of their religion and the heritage of their 

country. Bob Vance was in the lead among them, not because he had to be there 

but because he loved both his state and his nation too much to live out his 

days in comfortable silence.

<br><br>That wasn't all that Bob Vance loved. He loved his wife and two sons, nurtured 

and cherished them in ways that belied the notion that the family is a dead 

institution in America. He loved a good story, the latest gossip of courthouse 

and club, the intricate tall tales of Southern men caught up in old lies 

lovingly retold. His abiding passion was politics for its own sake, politics as 

a means to an end, politics as the daily embodiment of all the textbook virtues 

of good citizenship and constitutional arrangement. He fought George Wallace 

long and hard, won some of the big battles, lost some of the others and never 

forgot what the battles were ultimately all about -- a political system open to 

all and responsive to something more than expediency.

<br><br>And he was a fine judge. Coming home from the funeral, a Reagan appointee to 

the federal court in Georgia echoed the same praise offered to us earlier that 

same day by the legendary U.S. District Judge Frank Johnson of Alabama. Bob 

Vance was a man who ruled as the law demanded and the facts warranted, not as 

he might personally have wished the outcome to be. He was respected by those 

with whom he differed as well as by those on his side. As U.S. Bankruptcy Judge 

R. Clifford Fulford said in his eulogy on Wednesday, 

&quot;He saw and gave proportion to issues in terms of their possible solutions. He 

had the unique ability to draw his circles to include his adversaries and to 

join them in the search for common ground on which both could honorably stand.&quot;

<br><br>There were always people who hated the idea of a common ground, not just in the 

South but throughout the nation. With segregation's rout, with the election of 

politicians at the state and national level who spoke firmly of the need for 

racial justice, of equality given life beyond easy rhetoric, they were forced 

into isolation and seeming impotence.

<br><br>But they did not suddenly evaporate or vanish into thin air. They were there, 

pacing in the tortured jungles of their minds waiting for another day to hunt.

<br><br>For whatever reason, during the past decade they have decided their day has 

come again. Some believe the explanation lies in their frustration and 

isolation. Having lost on all fronts, political and legal, the white 

supremacists 

&quot;may feel like they have no other options left but 

violence,&quot; as Charles Wittenstein, Atlanta director of the Anti-Defamation League of 

B'nai B'rith, has said.

<br><br>Others see a different possibility. As Washington's commitment to equality took 

a back seat to other causes, as it became increasingly fashionable in high 

places to lament the burdens carried by racism's former beneficiaries rather 

than by its former victims, as grudging lip service to the notion of a common 

ground replaced fervent belief, the bigots sensed an end to their exile.

<br><br>They began the hunt anew, little noticed because their targets were virtually 

unknown outside their communities. No matter whose figures you choose to trust, 

the increase in incidents of racial hatred went up dramatically from the late 

1970s to now. The Community Relations Service of the U.S. Justice Department 

says such incidents went from eight in 1978 to 276 in 1986, according the 

Associated Press. A private group, the Center of Democratic Renewal, reports 

3,000 racial incidents between 1980 and 1986.

<br><br>Now, abruptly, the statistics are more than rows of conflicting numbers. They 

are faces of men who worked within our system of justice and politics, people 

who represented the triumph of the system's best tendencies over its worst: 

Robert Robinson in Savannah and Bob Vance in Birmingham -- alderman and judge, 

lawyers both, Southerns both, Americans both in a country far closer to living 

up to its promises than 25 or 50 or 100 years ago.

<br><br>On the day Bob Vance was killed by a pipe 

Bomb in his home in the suburbs of Birmingham, an event he would have loved was 

taking place in Greenville, Miss., some 300 miles to the west. About a thousand 

people, black and white, 

attended a banquet at the county coliseum to raise money for a foundation 

established by Rep. Mike Espy, the district's first black congressman. The 

foundation is intended to raise the sights and aspirations of the district's 

young men and women, to give them a sense of the world around them and its 

needs. Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.) gave the keynote, a moving, personal 

testament to the need for each human being to look deep within and reach far 

outside to confront the racism that afflicts us all. He was warmly introduced 

by Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.). And Don Payne, the first black congressman in 

New Jersey's history, was there with greetings as well.

<br><br>Only in America, you thought as you walked out of that remarkable evening. 

Still in America, came the mocking retort as we learned that Bob Vance had been 

struck down. 

But the killers are not the South and are not America, not anymore. It's hard 

to remember right about now, but Bob Vance would have been the first to say it, 

loud and clear. 



<br><br>The writers, both formerly of Mississippi, were long-time friends and political 

associates of Judge Vance.
