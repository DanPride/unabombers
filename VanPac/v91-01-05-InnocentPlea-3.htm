<strong>BODY:</strong><p class="subheader" align="Left"> 
<br>A man accused of mail bombings that killed a federal judge and a city 
councilman in two states pleaded innocent Friday.
<br><br>Walter Leroy Moody Jr., 56, was arraigned a second time before a federal 
magistrate in Atlanta on charges of sending the 1989 mail 
bombs that killed U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge 
<strong>Robert Vance</strong> in Alabama and Savannah civil rights lawyer and alderman Robert Robinson.  

<br><br>Moody was first arraigned on the charges Nov. 8, the day after his arrest. A 
second arraignment was held because he stood mute during the first hearing and 
the court had to enter a plea of innocent for him.
<br><br>On Friday, Moody entered his own innocent plea before U.S. Magistrate John 
Dougherty.
<br><br>His attorney, Ed Tolley, also told Dougherty that he will withdraw a motion 
Monday filed by Moody's previous attorney to bar federal judges from hearing 
the case.
<br><br>Instead, Tolley said he will ask that the case be moved outside the 11th 
Circuit, which includes Georgia, Florida and Alabama.
<br><br>Attorney Bruce Harvey filed the first motion in November, saying that no 
federal judges could be impartial because many of them 
&quot;altered their lifestyles&quot; after a series of letters accompanying the mail 
bombs declared 
&quot;war&quot; against the entire federal judiciary. He 
asked that the Senate Judiciary Committee appoint independent judicial officers 
to try the case.
<br><br>Moody was named in a 70-count federal indictment in connection with the mail 
bombings in December, 1989. He is charged with murdering Vance with a mail 
Bomb sent to the judge's home in suburban Birmingham, Ala., and with transporting 
explosive material with intent to kill in the death of Robinson.
<br><br>If convicted on all 70 counts in the mail 
bombs case, Moody could face life in prison.
