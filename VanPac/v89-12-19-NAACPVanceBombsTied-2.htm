<br>DeLoach and Special Agent William Hinshaw said the FBI is warning lawyers, 
judges and NAACP activists in Georgia and Alabama to beware of strange packages.
<br><br>Hinshaw said the FBI also warned the NAACP that the attacks appear to be 
related to the Aug. 22 tear-gas mail 
Bomb at NAACP's Atlanta offices. 
Eight people were injured.
<br><br>FBI agents earlier Monday said they saw ''strong similarities'' to mail 
bombings that killed U.S. Circuit Judge 
<strong>Robert Vance</strong> in Birmingham Saturday and panicked an Atlanta courthouse Monday.
<br><br>Postal Inspector John Paul confirmed that the Postal Service is investigating 
the Robinson slaying as well as Vance's because Robinson was killed by a 
Bomb that was in a package mailed to his office.
<br><br>In Washington, Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said, ''I think it's 
premature to draw any conclusions. ... At this time, there is no civil rights 
investigation.''
<br><br>In Atlanta Monday, a 10-inch-long parcel wrapped in brown paper and containing 
a pipe 
Bomb was discovered during X-ray screening of all mail to the court. Police 
disarmed it.
<br><br>Speculation on motives 
for the mail bombings also has focused on drugs.
<br><br>In the wake of the bombings, security was heightened:
<br><br>- In Greenville, S.C., U.S. Circuit Judge William Wilkins told his family not 
to open any packages mailed to his home ''unless I've had a chance to look at 
them.''
<br><br>- At U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, the site of big drug trials, U.S. Marshal 
Charles Healey said, ''We're definitely beefing up. ... Everything is going to 
be X-rayed.''
