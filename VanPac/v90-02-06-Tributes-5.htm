<strong>BODY:</strong><p class="subheader" align="Left"> 
<br>&#160;Shortly before Christmas, Federal Judge 
<strong>Robert Vance</strong> of the U.S.&#160; 
&#160; Court of Appeals received a package in his affluent, suburban&#160; 
&#160; Birmingham home.&#160;As he opened the package, his body was torn apart by a&#160; 
&#160; powerful pipe 
bomb.&#160;His wife also was injured in the blast.&#160;Two days&#160; 
&#160; later, Robert Robinson, an alderman and prominent Savannah, Ga.,&#160; 
&#160; lawyer, was killed when a similar package exploded in his face at the&#160; 
&#160; Savannah headquarters of the NAACP.&#160;Two additional 
bombs, which&#160; 
&#160; apparently were related to these two incidents, were mailed to the&#160; 
&#160; Jacksonville office of the NAACP and to the 11th Circuit Court of&#160; 
&#160; Appeals in Atlanta.&#160;However, they were detected before they could be&#160; 
&#160; detonated.
<br>&#160;
<br> 
&#160; 
&#160; Vance recently had written a blistering reversal of the Florida&#160; 
&#160; ruling that would have signaled a mandatory end to school busing to&#160; 
&#160; hundreds of schools throughout the South.&#160;In the past several years,&#160; 
&#160; Vance also had rendered unfavorable rulings 
against the Ku Klux Klan&#160; 
&#160; that awarded monetary damages to civil rights marchers.&#160;Robinson served&#160; 
&#160; as one of the NAACP's legal counsels who worked on appeals and other&#160; 
&#160; matters related to segregation practices within the Savannah school&#160; 
&#160; system.  

<br>&#160;
<br> 
&#160; 
&#160; These two courageous men, apparently unknown to each other, were&#160; 
&#160; professionally linked in the continuing struggle for equality and&#160; 
&#160; justice for blacks.
<br>&#160;
<br> 
&#160; 
&#160; Vance was white and described as a brilliant legal mind.&#160;It would&#160; 
&#160; have been easy for him to quietly accept a position in southern&#160; 
&#160; aristocracy and forsake his conscience on matters that would promote&#160; 
&#160; racial harmony and justice.&#160;But he chose to fairly administer the law&#160; 
&#160; that he had sworn to uphold.
<br>&#160;
<br> 
&#160; 
&#160; Robinson easily could have settled into a lifestyle of 
&quot;black&#160; 
&#160; bourgeoisie.&quot;&#160;However, he chose to use his prominence and brilliance&#160; 
&#160; to further educational goals of disadvantaged minority youth.&#160;Robinson&#160; 
&#160; obviously saw that illiteracy, unemployment and the failure of many&#160; 
&#160; black youths to compete successfully in a highly technical society were&#160; 
&#160; a result of disparities within our educational system and used his&#160; 
&#160; legal training and experience to remedy this situation.
<br>&#160;
<br> 
&#160; 
&#160; The U.S. system of justice may be imperfect, but as 
far as I know&#160; 
&#160; it's the best we have.&#160;Robinson realized this and sought to exercise&#160; 
&#160; his right as a U.S. citizen to call upon the law of the land to correct&#160; 
&#160; shortcomings in our educational system.&#160;This was certainly a proper&#160; 
&#160; thing to do.&#160;Robinson did not seek justice on the streets by rioting or&#160; 
&#160; other means of violent behavior.&#160;He did not seek a remedy to his&#160; 
&#160; complaint as a sniper through the telescope sights of a high-powered&#160; 
&#160; rifle.&#160;And, of course, he did not resort to the treachery of sending&#160; 
&#160; pipe 
bombs through the mail to kill innocent people in the sanctuary of&#160; 
&#160; their homes.
<br>&#160;
<br> 
&#160; 
&#160; Likewise, when Vance answered the call to be a federal judge he did&#160; 
&#160; so with a clear understanding that he had a responsibility to his&#160; 
&#160; country to make our judicial system work.&#160;I am certain that Vance&#160; 
&#160; realized that unless the law was applied fairly and equally, then&#160; 
&#160; within a short time our society would be 
inundated with terrorism,&#160; 
&#160; violence and anarchy.&#160;The truth of the matter is that if Vance rendered&#160; 
&#160; a decision against school desegregation, I would not have respected him&#160; 
&#160; any less.&#160;I may have disagreed with him, but at least he had the&#160; 
&#160; decency to use our justice system to settle disagreements.
<br>&#160;
<br> 
&#160; 
&#160; Unfortunately, everyone did not think as Robinson and Vance did,&#160; 
&#160; and as a result of their convictions, both of these fine men met with&#160; 
&#160; dastardly and untimely deaths.
<br>&#160;
<br> 
&#160; 
&#160; Thousands of years ago, a voice cried from the heavens saying,&#160; 
&#160; 
&quot;Whom shall I send and who will go for us?&quot;
<br>&#160;
<br> 
&#160; 
&#160; The Prophet Isaiah then said, 
&quot;Here am I, send me.&quot;&#160;I believe&#160; 
&#160; that this same voice echoed throughout the ages seeking men and women&#160; 
&#160; of goodwill who had the courage to bring about a better understanding&#160; 
&#160; of people of all races and nationalities.
<br>&#160;
<br> 
&#160; 
&#160; I believe that Vance and Robinson were moved by the eternal voice&#160; 
&#160; and gave themselves 
unselfishly to making this a better world.
<br>&#160;
<br> 
&#160; 
&#160; I don't know how others feel, but I am eternally grateful to them&#160; 
&#160; for having the courage of their convictions and their unselfish&#160; 
&#160; commitment to justice, decency and fair play.
