<br>The man accused of sending mail 
bombs that killed a judge and a lawyer declared a cowardly terrorist war on the 
court system because he could not overturn a 1972 conviction, a prosecutor said 
Wednesday.
<br><br>&quot;That's the driving force behind these crimes,&quot; Assistant U.S. Atty. Louis Freeh said in closing arguments at the trial of 
Walter Leroy Moody Jr. 
&quot;Retaliation is a way of life for Mr. Moody, and the court was only his last 
target. A deadly target.&quot; 

<br><br>Defense attorney Edward Tolley said the prosecution's case was largely 
circumstantial, offering no solid proof that Moody was guilty.
<br><br>&quot;Despite the mountain of evidence in this case, there is no evidence Walter 
Leroy Moody deposited these 
bombs in a mailbox,&quot; Tolley said.
<br><br>Moody, of Rex, Ga., is charged in a 71-count federal indictment with mailing 
the 
bombs that killed U.S. Circuit Judge 
<strong>Robert Vance</strong> at his home in Mountain Brook, Ala., and civil rights attorney Robert E. 
Robinson in Savannah, Ga., in December, 1989.
<br><br>He became a suspect when investigators found similarities between a 
Bomb that went off in Moody's house in 1972 and the 1989 bombings. Moody was 
convicted of pipe-Bomb possession in the earlier case.
<br><br>U.S. District Judge Edward Devitt said the 
jury would get the case today.
<br><br>So ruthless was the 57-year-old Moody, Freeh said, that he killed Robinson and 
mailed other 
bombs to NAACP offices in Jacksonville, Fla., and Atlanta to make it appear that the 
crimes were committed for racial reasons.
<br><br>The primary targets were Vance and the Atlanta-based U.S. 11th Circuit Court of 
Appeals, where one of Moody's mail 
bombs was intercepted, the prosecutor said.
<br><br>&quot;He blew that man to pieces as a diversion,&quot; Freeh said of the Robinson killing. 
&quot;He was thinking ahead, playing chess with the government.&quot;
<br><br>The prosecutor said Moody, a self-described inventor, literary consultant and 
publisher, hates blacks partly because he thought they received preferential 
treatment in the courts.
<br><br>But he said Moody was not an ideological racist and considered himself 
&quot;too good, too clever&quot; to belong to a group such as the Ku Klux Klan.
<br><br>Freeh said 
Vance was a perfect target because he had ruled in favor of blacks in a school 
desegregation case, saying their 20-year-old claim was not outdated.
<br><br>Moody read Vance's opinion shortly after his appeal of his 1972 conviction for 
pipe-Bomb possession was rejected in June, 1989, by the 11th Circuit. The reason, Freeh 
said, was that the case was too old.
<br><br>&quot;You could imagine how he felt,&quot; Freeh said. 
&quot;When that failed in 1989, Mr. Moody declared war against the courts. It's that 
simple.&quot;
