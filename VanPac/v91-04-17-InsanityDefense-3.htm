<br>SAVANNAH - The attorney for accused mail bomber Walter Leroy Moody&#160;Jr. told a federal judge today that his client should be granted a new&#160;trial in an unrelated case.
<br><br>Athens attorney Edward Tolley said the jury that convicted his&#160;client should have been instructed on an insanity defense even though&#160;Moody rejected that legal strategy.
<br><br>U.S. District Judge Anthony A. Alaimo, who presided at the trial and&#160;at today's hearing, said he will rule on Mr. Tolley's motion in a few&#160;days. 

<br><br>Moody, 56, looked thinner today than he did in December at his trial&#160;in Brunswick when he was convicted of obstructing justice, bribery and&#160;witness tampering.
<br><br>The former Rex resident, who served time in prison for setting a&#160;Bomb in 1972 that injured his then-wife, Hazel, spent almost two decades&#160;trying to exonerate himself.
<br><br>Government prosecutors claim it was Moody's hatred of the court&#160;system that led him to mail nail-packed pipe 
bombs that killed U.S.&#160;District Judge 
<strong>Robert Vance</strong> and Savannah attorney Robert Robinson in late&#160;1989. Moody is scheduled for trial later this year on those charges in&#160;St. Paul, Minn.
<br><br>Testimony at his Brunswick trial indicated Moody sought to clear his&#160;conviction in the 1972 case by concocting an alibi and bribing witnesses&#160;to testify that another 
man was responsible for injuring Hazel Moody.
<br><br>Mr. Tolley laid the groundwork for an insanity defense, calling&#160;experts who testified to Moody's mental problems, but just before the&#160;case went to the jury, Moody ignored Mr. Tolley's advice and withdrew his&#160;insanity plea.
<br><br>He said he feared being incarcerated for an indefinite period.&#160;Defendants found guilty but mentally ill are institutionalized until they&#160;are deemed well enough for release.
<br><br>Moody was convicted of obstructing justice, bribery and witness&#160;tampering.
<br><br>At the hearing, Judge Alaimo said Moody's behavior at the trial&#160;indicated he was aware of the risks of rejecting the insanity defense.
<br><br>Mr. Tolley argued today that the judge should have held a hearing to&#160;determine Moody's competency.
<br><br>&quot;Since he was not taking my advice and was in essence doing his own&#160;lawyering, the judge should have 
gone further and discussed it with him,&quot;&#160;Mr. Tolley said after the hearing.
