<strong>BODY:</strong><p class="subheader" align="Left"> 
<br>A man was found guilty of murder today in the mail-Bomb killing of a Federal judge in 1989 that came as part of a wave of violence 
that seemed intended against blacks.
<br><br>Jurors also recommended the death penalty for the defendant, Walter Leroy 
Moody, 51.  

<br><br> Sentencing is expected in about six weeks. Under Alabama law, a judge does not 
have to follow the jury's recommendation.
<br><br>Mr. Moody, who presented no defense during the trial, was convicted on two 
counts of capital murder and one count of first-degree assault in the attack on 
Judge 
<strong>Robert Vance</strong> of the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit.
<br><br>Judge Vance was killed in December 1989 as he opened a package in his kitchen 
in suburban Mountain Brook. The package 
Bomb also injured his wife, Helen.
<br><br>Mr. Moody, of Rex, Ga., is already serving a sentence of life without parole 
after his 1991 convictions on Federal charges in the deaths of Judge Vance and 
Robert Robinson, a civil rights lawyer and alderman in Savannah, Ga. 
Prosecutors also blamed him 
for package 
bombs sent to the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta, 
the court on which Judge Vance served, and an N.A.A.C.P. office in 
Jacksonville, Fla. Those devices were intercepted and disarmed.
<br><br>Mr. Moody had no lawyer for the trial, after suing two court-appointed lawyers 
in 1994 to force them off the case and refusing replacements.  Prosecutors 
contended Mr. Moody killed Judge Vance out of frustration and hatred over being 
unable to overturn a 1972 conviction on a charge of possessing a pipe 
bomb.
<br><br>Mr. Morrow said the 
Bomb sent to Alderman Robinson, who was black, was intended to make it appear that 
a hate group like the Ku Klux Klan was behind Judge Vance's killing.
