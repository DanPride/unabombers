<strong>BODY:</strong><br><br>ATLANTA - All federal judges in the U.S. 11th Circuit have voluntarily 
removedthemselves from presiding over the trial of accused mail-Bomb murderer Walter Leroy Moody.  The decision clears the way for U.S. Chief 
Justice William H. Rehnquist to appoint a special trial judge.  
Ten of the 11 judges in the 11th Circuit signed an order declaring that there 
exists ''a possibility of the appearance of impropriety.'' The only other 
judge, G. Ernest Tidwell, didn't agree but signed a separate order removing 
himself anyway, citing ''other circumstances.'' Moody is accused of mailing 
threatening letters to numerous federal judges, including those of the 11th 
Circuit, which consists of Georgia, Florida and Alabama.  Federal law provides 
that a judge should not preside over a trial ''if there exists the possibility 
that an objective, disinterested lay observer . .  . would entertain a 
significant doubt about the judge's impartiality.'' Moody is accused of mailing 
bombs that killed federal Judge 
<strong>Robert Vance</strong> and Savannah Alderman Robert Robinson.
