<strong>HEADLINE:</strong> US racist group claims responsibility for bombings

<strong>BODY:</strong><p class="subheader" align="Left"> 
<br>A PREVIOUSLY unknown US white racist group has claimed responsibility for a 
series of bombings in the South which included the killing of a Federal judge 
and a prominent black civil rights leader.
<br><br>The FBI said it is treating seriously the claim which appeared in a letter 
signed 'Americans for a Competent Federal Judiciary' which was read out in part 
on a television news station in Atlanta.
<br><br>In the letter, the group also threatened to kill two unnamed leading members of 
the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People, the black 
civil rights group, in reprisal for the rape and murder of a white exercise 
class teacher in Atlanta in 1988.  

<br><br>Last August, two black men were charged with rape and kidnapping in the widely 
publicised case.
<br><br>The TV station's decision to broadcast portions of the letter was made on the 
advice of the FBI, which was concerned about a threat of further violence if 
the letter was not made available to the media. But the move has already proved 
controversial.
<br><br>One TV official said 'it is a strange situation to be covering the story and 
then becoming part of it.' Other observers noted the letter's violent, racist 
language which included a threat to kill one federal judge, one attorney and 
one NAACP member 'anytime a black man rapes a white woman in Alabama, Florida 
or Georgia.'
<br><br>Going public with the letter on Thursday night has aroused fears among the 
black community in Atlanta that a new, racially motivated white 
supremacist network may have sprung up. But there is no firm proof of this and 
the FBI believes it could be the work of a deranged individual.
<br><br>The FBI also disclosed that the same group sent out letters last week after 
this month's pipe 
Bomb attacks, two of which were defused and two of which exploded, killing Judge 
<strong>Robert Vance</strong> in his Birmingham, Alabama home and Mr Robert Robinson, an attorney in 
Savannah, Georgia. Until recently, there had been speculation that the killings 
were reprisals for the Bush administration's crackdown on Latin American 
narcotics traffickers.
