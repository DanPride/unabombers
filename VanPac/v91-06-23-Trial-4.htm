<strong>DATELINE:</strong> ST. PAUL, June 22 

<br>
<br>
<strong>BODY:</strong><p class="subheader" align="Left"> 
<br>The man charged with killing a Federal judge in Alabama and a civil rights 
lawyer in Georgia has testified that the Ku Klux Klan made and mailed the 
package 
bombs that killed the two men a year and a half ago. 

<br><br>In his third day of testifying against the advice of his lawyers, the 
57-year-old defendant, Walter Leroy Moody Jr. of Rex, Ga., said Friday that the 
bombings were the Klan's revenge against the Federal court system for its 
handling of a lawsuit stemming from a 1987 civil rights march in Cumming, Ga.  

<br><br> The suit, filed by 49 blacks injured by white hecklers who had lined the route 
of the march, resulted in October 1988 in a jury's $950,000 judgment against 
the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and another white supremacist 
organization, the Georgia Realm of the Invisible Empire. The verdict was upheld 
by a Federal appeals court. 

<br><br>In his testimony, Mr. Moody said he learned of the Klan's involvement in the 
bombings during meetings he had in January and February 1990, only weeks after 
the killings, with Michael Ford, a lawyer who represented him in an appeal of a 
1972 conviction for 
Bomb possession. 

<br><br>Mr. Moody said that at the meetings Mr. Ford claimed to know the identity of 
the person within the Klan who had mailed the 
bombs but that he refused to disclose it. 
&quot;You don't want to 
know,&quot; Mr. Moody quoted Mr. Ford as saying. 
&quot;He's affiliated with the Klan.&quot;
<br>&#160;
<br>Rambling Testimony
<br><br>
<br> 

<br><br>Mr. Moody also quoted Mr. Ford as saying that 
&quot;items&quot; that Mr. Moody had sent to Mr. Ford had later ended up in one of the 
bombs. According to Mr. Moody, Mr. Ford told him, 
&quot;I may be involved, and you may be, too.&quot; 

<br><br>Mr. Moody's testimony was often rambling, and it was unclear whether the 
&quot;items&quot; were ingredients used in the 
Bomb or whether they were perhaps just written material. But later in his 
testimony, Mr. Moody said Mr. Ford had taken credit for providing the powder 
for both 
bombs. 

<br><br>Reached in Georgia, Dave Holland, director of the White Knights of dhe Ku Klux 
Klan, denied that his organization was responsible for the bombings. 

<br><br>&quot;The F.B.I. has spent a fortune investigating this case,&quot; Mr. Holland said. 
&quot;They've got their 
man.&quot; 

<br><br>In Atlanta, Mr. Ford refused to comment on Mr. Moody's testimony. So did Mr. 
Moody's lawyer, Edward Tolley. 

<br><br>Mr. Ford made no mention of the Ku Klux Klan when he testified against Mr. 
Moody earlier in the trial, telling mainly about lies that Mr. Moody and his 
former wife told in court in a failed attempt to overturn the 1972 
Bomb-possession conviction. 

<br><br>Mr. Moody is on trial in the deaths of Judge 
<strong>Robert Vance</strong> of the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, who was killed at 
his home in Mountain Brook, Ala., and of Robert E. Robinson, a lawyer in 
Savannah, Ga.
<br><br>He is also accused of mailing a 
Bomb to the Federal courthouse in Atlanta, mailing a 
Bomb to the Jacksonville, Fla., offices of the National Association 
for the Advancement of Colored People and mailing a tear-gas 
Bomb that exploded at the N.A.A.C.P.'s Atlanta office. 

<br><br>The Government contends that Mr. Moody, who years ago attended law classes at 
night in Atlanta, wanted to undermine the court system because his 1972 
conviction had kept him from obtaining a license to practice law.
