Bomb probe seized by FBI

<strong>BODY:</strong><p class="subheader" align="Left"> 
<br>FBI agents seized items that could be used to make a pipe 
Bomb such as those that killed a federal judge and civil-rights lawyer during a 
search of property owned by a man convicted 18 years ago of possessing a 
similar 
<strong>bomb,</strong> a newspaper reported today. 

<br><br>The Atlanta Constitution quoted federal sources it did not identify as saying 
laboratory tests are pending to establish whether the items found on the 
property of Walter Moody Jr. match the two 
bombs that exploded in December.  

<br><br>The 
bombs sent through the mail killed U.S. Circuit Court Judge 
<strong>Robert Vance</strong> in Alabama and lawyer Robert Robinson of Savannah, Ga. Two other 
bombs were intercepted. 

<br><br>Investigators confiscated 2 1/2 -inch pipe, six-penny nails, rubber bands, 
alarm wire, flashlight bulbs, bolts, paper clips, gunpowder-packed bullets and 
welding machinery -- all similar to items used to make the mail 
bombs, the newspaper said. 

<br><br>Also seized were adhesives, brown paper, labels, tape and 
&quot;old&quot; string, the paper reported.  Similar materials -- particularly a unique string 
that has not been manufactured for about seven years -- were used on the 
packages in which the four 
bombs were mailed. 

<br><br>The Constitution reported that agents seized the following: 

<br><br>o Seventeen 25-cent 
&quot;flag over Yosemite&quot; postage stamps in the pocketbook of 
Susan McBride, who lives with Moody.  That stamp was used on all four package 
bombs. 

<br><br>o Highlighted newspaper clippings about the FBI's investigation of Robert Wayne 
O'Ferrell, an Enterprise, Ala., junk-store owner whose home and business were 
searched last month and who has been questioned repeatedly. 

<br><br>o Two typewriters that were examined on the scene and determined not to match 
the ones used by 
&quot;Americans for a Competent Federal Judicial System.&quot;
