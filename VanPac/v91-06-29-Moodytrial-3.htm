<br>ST. PAUL - Walter Leroy Moody Jr. sat stoically Friday afternoon as&#160;he heard the word 
&quot;guilty&quot; pronounced on him 71 times for the December&#160;1989 Southeastern mail bombings.
<br><br>The verdict by a Minnesota federal court jury came as little&#160;surprise to the 57-year-old Georgian's attorneys or, they said, to Moody&#160;himself. 
&quot;We're lawyers, not magicians,&quot; said Athens, Ga., defense&#160;attorney Edward D. Tolley.  

<br><br>Convicted on every count in his indictment for the pipe bombings&#160;that killed U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Robert S. Vance and&#160;Savannah civil rights attorney Robert E. Robinson, Moody could be&#160;sentenced to a maximum seven life terms, plus 415 years in prison.
<br><br>Moody, who was being held at Oak Park Heights state prison, will be&#160;sentenced in St. Paul by U.S. District Judge Edward J. Devitt in August&#160;or September, Mr. Tolley said.
<br><br>&quot;This is a long time coming,&quot; said Helen Vance, who testified early&#160;in the trial of how her husband was killed instantly opening a package&#160;that exploded and hurled a volley of nails into his abdomen. The first&#160;count in the indictment, first-degree murder of a U.S. 
judge, 
&quot;was the&#160;one that I really wanted,&quot; she said. 
&quot;He was guilty for killing my&#160;husband, and the rest was gravy.&quot;
<br><br>Barbara Pulliam, one of Mr. Robinson's two sisters, had attended&#160;most of the trial. 
&quot;When I saw all the evidence, I was positive he would&#160;be found guilty,&quot; said Mrs. Pulliam, reached at her home in Augusta. 
&quot;I&#160;don't see how it's humanly possible that a juror could see all they had&#160;and not find him guilty.&quot;
<br><br>The jury sent word at 3:45 p.m. (CDT) after 13 hours of deliberation&#160;over two days they had reached a verdict. The trial was moved to St. Paul&#160;because of massive publicity in the Southeast and the fact that all&#160;federal judges in the 11th Circuit - covering Georgia, Alabama and&#160;Florida - recused themselves from the case.
<br><br>The defendant, who had folded his hands under his chin as U.S.&#160;District Court 
clerk Deborah Siebrecht began to read the lengthy verdict,&#160;dropped them to his lap seconds after the first count of guilty and sat&#160;without expression as successive counts of guilty were pronounced for the&#160;death of Mr. Robinson, transporting explosives, threatening to kill all&#160;17 judges in the 11th Circuit and mailing threatening letters to&#160;television stations.
<br><br>Besides mailing the pipe 
bombs that killed Judge Vance and Mr.&#160;Robinson, Moody was also convicted of sending pipe 
bombs that were&#160;intercepted in December 1989 at 11th Circuit headquarters in Atlanta and&#160;the Jacksonville office of the NAACP and mailing a tear-gas cannister in&#160;August 1989 to the NAACP regional office in Atlanta that injured 15&#160;people.
<br><br>Special prosecutors Louis J. Freeh and Howard M. Shapiro, brought to&#160;the Southeast from New York City to prosecute the mail 
Bomb cases,&#160;refused to make any comment, referring reporters to a statement from&#160;Washington by U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh.
<br><br>The attorney general called Moody's conviction a victory for 
&quot;one of&#160;the most intensive investigations and manhunts ever carried out by the&#160;Justice Department. These bombings were horrendous crimes which not only&#160;destroyed lives but represented a grave attack on the federal court&#160;system as well.&quot;
<br><br>Mr. Thornburgh praised the excellent cooperation among federal,&#160;Georgia and Alabama authorities. The FBI, he said, 
&quot;performed superbly in&#160;this case, devoting over 140,000 man hours and 11 months to get their&#160;man.' 
&quot;
<br><br>The son of a Fort Valley garage mechanic, Moody was portrayed by&#160;scores of witnesses as a practiced con man and failed would-be lawyer. He&#160;was convicted in 1972 and served nearly four years in the 
Atlanta Federal&#160;Penitentiary for possession of a package 
Bomb that exploded at his home&#160;in Macon, injuring his first wife.
<br><br>In his closing argument, Mr. Freeh called Moody a 
&quot;terrorist&quot; who&#160;mailed 
bombs to lash out at the 11th Circuit and a judicial system that&#160;would not reverse his 1972 conviction. The defendant sent 
bombs to Mr.&#160;Robinson and two NAACP offices, as well as letters blaming the federal&#160;courts for favoritism to blacks largely as a diversion - to make&#160;authorities zero in on the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist&#160;groups rather than a single malcontent with a personal grievance with the&#160;federal judiciary.
<br><br>Moody, a self-described literary consultant with a 130 IQ, testified&#160;for four days in his own defense against his attorneys' advice. He&#160;insisted that he was 
innocent and blamed the bombings on the Ku Klux Klan&#160;and a former attorney of his, Michael C. Ford of Chamblee. He gave&#160;little, if any, explanation in his testimony about why Mr. Ford would be&#160;involved in the bombings.
<br><br>Moody 
&quot;hurt himself tremendously by testifying,&quot; said Mr. Tolley,&#160;the defense attorney. 
&quot;We fought a good fight, but, like Louis Freeh&#160;said, there was a mountain of evidence.&quot;
<br><br>Moody's testimony confirmed 
&quot;probably 90 percent of the government's&#160;case,&quot; Mr. Tolley added. Asked if the defendant had expressed any regret&#160;at ignoring his attorneys' entreaties not to testify, Mr. Tolley said,&#160;&quot;The average person would probably regret not taking our advice, but then&#160;Roy is not average. He's keeping his own council.&quot;
<br><br>Co-defense counsel Don Samuel of Atlanta said Moody quietly thanked&#160;his attorneys after the 
verdict but said nothing more. Asked if he&#160;anticipated an appeal, Mr. Tolley said he did.
<br><br>Moody claimed that Mr. Ford, who once represented him in an&#160;unsuccessful appeal, told him the Ku Klux Klan committed the bombings&#160;because the 11th Circuit ruled against them in a $ 950,000 damage suit by&#160;civil rights marchers in Forsyth County four years ago. Moody said Mr.&#160;Ford admitted he was involved in the bombings.
<br><br>Mr. Ford, who testified as a prosecution rebuttal witness that&#160;Moody's claims were fraudulent, issued his own statement Friday in&#160;Atlanta expressing delight with the verdict.
<br><br>&quot;He set about taking advantage of our legal efforts on his behalf&#160;while he was planning and carrying out a very sinister plot against the&#160;legal system,&quot; Mr. Ford said.
<br><br>&quot;In addition, he insulted 
all of Atlanta and Georgia by choosing to&#160;build a scenario of racism and alleged Ku Klux Klan connections to try to&#160;save himself. We are very pleased that the Minnesota jury showed him that&#160;the old stereotypes are dead.&quot;
