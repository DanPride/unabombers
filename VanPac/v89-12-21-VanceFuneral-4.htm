<strong>BODY:</strong><br><br>MOUNTAIN BROOK, Ala. (AP) - 
Bomb-sniffing dogs and squadrons of police provided tight security Wednesday as 
mourners paid their respects to a federal appeals judge killed by the first in 
a series of mail 
bombs.  St. Luke's Episcopal Church was filled to overflowing with more than 700 
people, who were urged to put aside their anger over the killing long enough to 
remember the work of U.S. Court of Appeals Judge 
<strong>Robert Vance.</strong>  Dogs searched the church before the service, and dozens of officers kept 
watch during the 35-minute program of scripture, hymns and a eulogy.  Vance, 
58, a member of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court and a former chairman of the 
Alabama Democratic Party, was killed instantly Saturday when the 
Bomb exploded in his home, propelling nails into his lower abdomen. His wife, 
Helen, was injured in the 
bombing and remained hospitalized Wednesday.  A similar 
Bomb two days later killed a civil rights lawyer in Savannah, Ga., city Alderman 
Robert Robinson. A package 
Bomb was found in the Atlanta courthouse including the 11th Circuit on Monday, and 
a fourth mailed 
Bomb was removed Tuesday from the headquarters in Jacksonville, Fla., of the 
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.  The FBI said 
Wednesday that all four 
bombs had Georgia postmarks or return addresses.  pN hJ Ca All four targets can be 
linked to school desegregation efforts by the NAACP, leading investigators to 
speculate that a white racist group may be responsible.  
These factors were being considered: The 11th Circuit hears federal appeals 
from Georgia, Florida and Alabama, including desegregation cases.  Vance wrote 
a decision in September in which the appeals court ruled in favor of the 
Jacksonville NAACP in its desegregation suit against Jacksonville schools.  
Robinson was the Savannah NAACP's local counsel and had helped with an NAACP 
suit against the Savannah schools. The NAACP lost that case at the 11th 
Circuit; the three-judge panel that heard the case did not include Vance.  
Robinson had also advised the Jacksonville NAACP chapter in its desegregation 
case, according to a Jacksonville activist, the Rev. Fred Newbill.  At Vance's 
service, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Clifford Fulford of Birmingham, a close friend 
of Vance, delivered the eulogy, asking the mourners to ''put aside our outrage 
for a while'' to honor Vance.  ''The 
assassins were cheated if they thought that Bob Vance was afraid to die,'' 
Fulford said. He described Vance as a strong believer in the law and a man 
''who stood up for the underdog and the oppressed.'' Among those who attended 
the service were FBI Director William S. Sessions, Attorney General Dick 
Thornburgh and Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, the justice who oversees 
the operations of the 11th Circuit.
