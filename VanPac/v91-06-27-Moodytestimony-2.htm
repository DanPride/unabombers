<br> After 17 days of having his character battered by the prosecution, smeared by 
acquaintances and presenting himself as his only defense witness, Walter Leroy 
Moody today leaves his fate to a jury.
<br><br>Jurors today begin deliberating 71 counts against Moody, charged with the 1989 
racially motivated mail-Bomb deaths of 11th U.S. Circuit Judge 
<strong>Robert Vance</strong> of Mountain Brook, Ala., and civil rights lawyer Robert Robinson, a Savannah, 
Ga., alderman.
<br><br>Moody also is charged with mailing threats to 17 federal judges in Georgia, 
Alabama and Florida and 
bombs to NAACP offices in the South and death threats to civil rights officials. If 
convicted, Moody faces life imprisonment.  

<br><br>The case was moved from Georgia after the defense argued Moody, 57, of Rex, 
Ga., couldn't get a fair trial in the South.
<br><br>A trial whose highlight was a bizarre three days of testimony by Moody followed 
by a day of gruelling cross-examination ended unceremoniously with closing 
arguments Wednesday.
<br><br>Prosecutor Louis Freeh reminded jurors of testimony that Moody made ''a 
declaration of war'' against the judicial system. Freeh repeated the horrors of 
the crimes, including detailing the death of Robinson, who he said thrashed in 
pain for three hours before he died.
<br><br>''Walter's work,'' Freeh said sternly. ''Moody is an absolute coward. Sending 
bombs to people when you're hundreds of miles away is a coward's crime.''
<br><br>Freeh recapped testimony and evidence that he said proved Moody is a con man 
and 
a liar who abuses people and ''believes the end justifies the means.''
<br><br>''Mr. Moody is the stealth bomber,'' Freeh said. ''He'll do what he has to do 
to get what he wants. ... His 
bombs are made and designed and delivered with great stealth, great cleverness. This 
is a 130-IQ genius at work, a mastermind.''
<br><br>Moody sat impassively, often taking notes, never looking at the jury.
<br><br>The prosecution contends Moody had a grudge with federal judges over his 
failure to get a 1972 
Bomb conviction overturned.
<br><br>Edward Tolley, Moody's court-appointed lawyer, conceded his client's faults.
<br><br>''At the start of the trial I told you, you would not like Roy Moody,'' he 
said. ''But you can't find him guilty of being an unpleasant fellow. ... You 
are here to determine whether there is any truth to the indictment.''
<br><br>Days earlier, Tolley admitted that his client's insistence on taking the 
witness stand 
in his own defense ''had hurt him.''
<br><br>In a rambling chronology, Moody tried to show he was not where the government 
said he was in connection with the bombings.
<br><br>His testimony, sometimes punctuated by tears and his clutching and quoting the 
Bible, included such minutiae as an almost hourly account of a trip to Daytona 
Beach, Fla., where he told of making love to his wife, Susan, in a motel 
swimming pool at 1 a.m. and making pornographic videotapes with her.
<br><br>''I am sorry Roy rambled and rambled and rambled for three days,'' Tolley told 
jurors.
