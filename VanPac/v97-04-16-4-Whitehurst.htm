<br> An FBI explosives expert working in one of the most important criminal 
investigations in US history - the Oklahoma City bombing - improperly tailored 
his conclusions to help build an incriminating case against the defendants.
<br>&#160;
<br> The same expert took similar actions during the World Trade Center bombing 
case, according to a new report by the Justice Department's Inspector General.
<br>&#160;
<br> The report is the result of an 18-month investigation of allegations of sloppy 
work and bias among officials assigned to the FBI's crime laboratory. The 
allegations were made by a lab scientist, Frederic Whitehurst, who first 
complained about questionable work in 1994.  

<br>&#160;
<br> Mr. Whitehurst has since been suspended from his job.
<br>&#160;
<br> While the full impact of the report is unclear, it could help the defense in 
the Oklahoma City bombing trial - and may lead to the reopening of many other 
major criminal cases.
<br>&#160;
<br> The report, released on April 15, will offer defense attorneys for Timothy 
McVeigh evidence of potential bias by federal agents. The lawyers could use 
such information to attempt to plant seeds of doubt in the minds of jurors.
<br>&#160;
<br> Attorney General Janet Reno said the Justice Department has reviewed 
&quot;thousands of cases&quot; to determine whether new information about FBI lab work would undermine any 
convictions.
<br>&#160;
<br> 
&quot;So far, only 55 cases have been identified nationwide where prosecutors needed 
to be alerted,&quot; she says. Of those, Reno says, prosecutors notified defense attorneys of 
possible problems in 25 cases.
<br>&#160;
<br> Questions about 13 of those cases have 
already been argued in court and all were resolved without any change in the 
outcome of the case, Reno says.
<br>&#160;
<br> The Inspector General's investigation focused on the work of agents in three 
sections of the FBI crime lab, the explosives unit, the materials analysis 
unit, and the chemistry-toxicology unit.
<br>&#160;
<br> Their work included some of the most significant cases in the country. In 
addition to Oklahoma City and the World Trade Center bombing cases, the 
investigation tracked lab work in cases including the O.J. Simpson case, the 
mail-Bomb assassination in 1989 of US Circuit Judge 
<strong>Robert Vance,</strong> and the 1989 bombing of an Avianca Airlines flight near Bogota, Colombia.
<br>&#160;
<br> The FBI lab has long enjoyed a reputation as the nation's premier crime lab, 
where the most up-to-date crime-fighting technology is paired with the nation's 
best 
investigators. Whitehurst's allegations, and now the inspector general's 
report, are taking some of the gloss off that reputation.
<br>&#160;
<br> At the heart of Whitehurst's criticisms was the suggestion that FBI lab work 
was seen as an adjunct to the work of prosecutors, helping to make cases and 
convict suspected criminals. Whitehurst has argued that lab workers should be 
scientists, completely objective on the question of a suspect's possible guilt. 
He alleged that some FBI workers had stopped being scientists and had become 
tools of the prosecution.
<br>&#160;
<br> In the Oklahoma City case, the inspector general found that agent David 
Williams authored a report in which he reached conclusions that could not be 
supported by scientific evidence.
<br>&#160;
<br> His conclusions served the purpose of tying the defendants to the 
Bomb scene. For example, he concluded that the explosive used in the 
Bomb was ammonium nitrate and fuel oil. This conclusion was supposedly based on an 
analysis of the velocity of the 
explosion by studying the shrapnel damage of the blast. Based on that damage he 
found that ammonium nitrate and fuel oil was the explosive. But other 
explosives show the same characteristics, the report says.
<br>&#160;
<br> Later, when questioned about his finding, Williams acknowledged that he 
reached that conclusion in part because Terry Nichols, one of the defendants, 
purchased ammonium nitrate and diesel oil prior to the bombing.
<br>&#160;
<br> 
&quot;We are troubled that the opinions in the Williams report may have been tailored 
to conform to the evidence associated with the defendants,&quot; the inspector general's report says. 
&quot;These errors were all tilted in such a way as to incriminate the defendant.&quot;
<br>&#160;
<br> The inspector general reached a similar conclusion about Williams's 
identification of the type of explosive used in the World Trade Center bombing 
and his testimony at that trial.
<br>&#160;
<br> 
&quot;Williams gave inaccurate and incomplete testimony ... that appeared tailored to 
the most incriminating result,&quot; the report concluded.
<br>&#160;
