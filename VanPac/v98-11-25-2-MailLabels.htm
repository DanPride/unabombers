Bomb probe suit rejected 
</p><p class="subheader">
<strong>BODY:</strong><p class="subheader" align="Left">  </p>
<p class="subheader">A federal judge in Birmingham ruled Tuesday that the FBI owes nothing to a junk 
dealer whose $ 50 million lawsuit claimed a misdirected mail 
Bomb investigation in 1990 ruined his health, reputation and livelihood. U.S. 
District Judge Harold Albritton said the government is shielded from such 
damage claims and did not recklessly disregard the truth when search warrants 
were issued for Robert Wayne O'Ferrell's home and surplus store in January 
1990. During the investigation of O'Ferrell, agents looked for a typewriter 
with keys to match the typed labels on mail 
bombs that killed U.S. Circuit Judge 
<strong>Robert Vance</strong> of Mountain Brook, Ala., and civil rights lawyer Robert Robinson of Savannah 
in 1989. The typewriter was never found, but FBI investigators determined the 
mail 
Bomb labels matched letters that O'Ferrell had 
previously written to the courts. O'Ferrell, 55, and his former wife, Mary Ann 
Martin, said in their lawsuit that agents pursued O'Ferrell despite knowing 
that Walter Leroy Moody of Rex, Ga., was the bomber. They sought $ 25 million 
each. Moody was convicted and sentenced to death in the mail bombing that 
killed Vance.  

<br> <br>Late-term abortion law thrown out A federal judge in Miami threw out a Florida 
law banning a controversial type of late-term abortion Tuesday, ruling that the 
measure is unconstitutionally vague. The 1997 law 
&quot;has the unconstitutional purpose and effect of placing a substantial obstacle 
in the path of women seeking an abortion prior to the fetus attaining viability,&quot; said U.S. District Judge Donald Graham. The law outlawed a procedure described 
by opponents as 
&quot;partial-birth abortion,&quot; in which a fetus is partly delivered and destroyed. Graham ruled that the law 
prohibited some early abortions and failed to protect a pregnant woman's health.
<br><br> Sleepwalker awakens surrounded by gators A 77-year-old Florida man with a 
habit of sleepwalking awoke to find himself up to his 
armpits in alligators. James Currens wandered behind his Palm Harbor home early 
Monday and stumbled into a pond. He woke up in several feet of water, his legs 
stuck in the mud. He said several alligators, some longer than 3 feet, came 
around. Currens said he poked at them with his cane to try to keep them away. A 
neighbor heard him yelling and called police, who used lights to scare off the 
gators and freed Currens. The retired maintenance supervisor suffered only 
minor cuts on his legs and arms from the fall.
<br><br> Viagra to get new warning label Since last spring, 130 Americans who took 
Viagra, the popular impotence drug, have died. The Food and Drug Administration 
says the majority of the deaths were from heart attacks, but it stresses there 
is no proof the drug caused the deaths. 
Even so, the FDA has notified doctors that manufacturer Pfizer is changing the 
drug's label to add more explicit warnings that Viagra users have reported 
cases of heart attacks and high blood pressure to the FDA.
<br><br> 180 tons of beef recalled in Southeast About 359,000 pounds of various beef 
products shipped to discount stores in Georgia and three other Southeastern 
states have been voluntarily recalled because they may be contaminated with E. 
coli bacteria, the U.S. Agriculture Department announced Tuesday. The beef was 
processed by Colorado Boxed Beef Co. of Auburndale, Fla. It was sold at 
Winn-Dixie, Albertson's and Wal-Mart stores in North Carolina, Florida, Georgia 
and South Carolina.
