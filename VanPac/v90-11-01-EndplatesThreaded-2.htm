Bomb connected to recent deaths

<strong>BODY:</strong><p class="subheader" align="Left"> 
<br>Federal agents say they have e found similarities between a pipe 
Bomb used by a Georgia man in 1972 and 
bombs that killed a federal judge and an attorney last year. 

<br><br>The 
<strong>bombs'</strong> construction was unlike that of any of 10,000 
bombs that federal agents have dissected, Agent Frank Lee of the federal Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said in an affidavit made public yesterday. 

<br><br>Similarities included the use of 
&quot;square end plates with threaded rods extending from plate to plate within the 
pipe and secured with nuts,&quot; the February search warrant affidavit said.  

<br><br>That construction 
&quot;is unique to the explosive device&quot; Walter Leroy Moody Jr. was convicted of having in 1972 and three of four mail 
bombs sent in December 1989, Lee said. 

<br><br>He said he based the conclusion on a computer search of ATF and FBI records 
describing more than 10,000 
bombs nationwide since 1975. 

<br><br>One of the December 
bombs killed Judge 
<strong>Robert Vance</strong> of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta. Another killed Savannah 
lawyer Robert Robinson.  Two other 
bombs were safely intercepted at the 11th Circuit offices and at the Jacksonville, 
Fla., office of the NAACP. 

<br><br>Moody, 56, of Rex, Ga., is a suspect in the slayings but has not been charged.  
He's being held without bail on unrelated charges. 

<br><br>Moody and his wife, Susan, 27, are charged with obstruction of justice, bribery 
and witness tampering 
for allegedly trying to erase his 1972 conviction for possessing the pipe 
Bomb that injured his ex-wife, Hazel. 

<br><br>The Moodys have requested separate trials.  Walter Moody's trial is set for 
Nov. 27. 

<br><br>U.S. District Judge Anthony Alaimo on Monday granted the Moodys' request to 
move the trials outside the 11th District, from Macon to Brunswick.  The ruling 
was made public in a written order yesterday. 

<br><br>Alaimo gave no reason for moving the trial.
