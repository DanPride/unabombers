<strong>BODY:</strong><p class="subheader" align="Left"> 
<br>Threatening follow-up letters have been sent to at least two of the four 
targets of mail 
bombs that killed a federal judge and a lawyer, investigators said yesterday. 

<br><br>In revealing the existence of the letters, investigators said they may have 
been sent by those responsible for the bombings, which are believed to be 
linked to civil-rights cases in the South. 

<br><br>Officials refused to reveal where the two letters were sent or their contents.  

<br><br>The four targets of the 
bombs were federal Judge 
<strong>Robert Vance;</strong> his court, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta; Savannah 
attorney Robert Robinson; and the Jacksonville, Fla., NAACP. 

<br><br>Vance was killed in his suburban Birmingham, Ala., home Saturday when a 
nail-studded 
Bomb exploded; Robinson was killed in his office by a 
Bomb Monday.  The packages sent to the court and the NAACP office were defused 
safely. 

<br><br>Vance's wife, Helen, is in serious but stable condition with injuries suffered 
in the bombing. 

<br><br>&quot;There have been follow-up letters sent since receipt of the 
Bomb parcels,&quot; said Leo Shatzel, postal inspector in charge in Atlanta.  
&quot;It appears they may have been sent by the individual who sent the parcels. 

<br><br>&quot;They were threatening additional mailings to other individuals.&quot; 

<br><br>Asked if the letters specifically threatened further bombings, he said, 
&quot;No.&quot; 

<br><br>None of the letters specifically claims responsibility for the bombings on 
behalf of a person or group, said William Hinshaw, chief of the FBI's Atlanta 
office; nor do they describe 
&quot;to a T&quot; the details of the four mail 
bombs, which would lead investigators to believe the follow-up letters were sent by 
the bomber. 

<br><br>All four packages have been linked to civil-rights cases: Vance and other 11th 
Circuit judges have handled school desegregation and other civil-rights cases 
from Georgia, Alabama and Florida; the Jacksonville NAACP recently won a school 
desegregation case in the Atlanta court; and Robinson had represented the 
Savannah NAACP in a school desegregation case. 

<br><br>There were 
Bomb scares at two Alabama court buildings yesterday, but nothing was found. 

<br><br>One was at the Birmingham court of U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Clifford Fulford of 
Birmingham, who 
gave the eulogy at Vance's funeral Wednesday. 

<br><br>In Decatur, Ala., a suspicious package was found outside the building that 
houses the post office and bankruptcy court.  It was detonated, but found to 
contain only clothing, said Decatur police Sgt. Johnny Coker. 

<br><br>In Savannah, Robinson's family scheduled his funeral for tomorrow. 

<br><br>Security will be tight, said Savannah Police Capt. Dan Reynolds, adding that 
police have been told to expect NAACP Executive Director Benjamin Hooks. 

<br><br>An FBI behavioral psychologist with experience in serial-killing cases has 
joined the investigation of the bombings, said bureau spokesman Tom Moore. 

<br><br>The psychologist, FBI agent William Hagmaier, has gone to Birmingham to help 
develop a profile of the person who sent the package to Vance, Moore said.
