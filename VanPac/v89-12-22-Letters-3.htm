<strong>BODY:</strong><p class="subheader" align="Left"> 
<br>&#160;BIRMINGHAM, Ala. - Investigators are examining letters sent recently&#160; 
&#160; to some of the targets of mailed 
bombs this week to determine if they&#160; 
&#160; come from the sender of the 
bombs.
<br>&#160;
<br> 
&#160; 
&#160; Allen Whitaker, the FBI agent in charge here, said at a news&#160; 
&#160; conference Thursday that some of the letters received since the&#160; 
&#160; bombings could be interpreted as claims of responsibility.  

<br>&#160;
<br> 
&#160; 
&#160; Four mailed 
bombs were received in three states between Saturday&#160; 
&#160; and Tuesday.&#160;Two exploded, killing a federal judge in Birmingham and a&#160; 
&#160; lawyer in Savannah, Ga.&#160; 
&#160; 
&#160; 
&#160; 
&quot;There have been followup letters sent since the receipt of the&#160; 
&#160; 
Bomb parcels,&quot; U.S. Postal Inspector Leo Shatzel confirmed in Atlanta.&#160; 
&#160; 
&quot;It appears these letters may have been sent by the individual who&#160; 
&#160; mailed the parcels.&quot;
<br>&#160;
<br> 
&#160; 
&#160; Investigators would not divulge details of the letters, who&#160; 
&#160; received them or what they said.&#160;Whitaker said 
&quot;there are numerous&#160; 
&#160; communications, written and telephonic, that are being evaluated.&quot;
<br>&#160;
<br> 
&#160; 
&#160; Shatzel described the letters as 
&quot;threatening.&quot;
<br>&#160;
<br> 
&#160; 
&#160; The FBI offices in Birmingham, Jacksonville and Atlanta have set up&#160; 
&#160; local telephone lines seeking tips from the public that might help&#160; 
&#160; their investigation.&#160;The U.S. Postal Inspection Service has also set up&#160; 
&#160; a tip line in Atlanta.
<br>&#160;
<br> 
&#160; 
&#160; The establishment of the phone lines suggested that 
investigators&#160; 
&#160; still are searching for a breakthrough in the inquiry.&#160;Whitaker said an&#160; 
&#160; informed tip might provide a shortcut to the task of sifting through&#160; 
&#160; the 
&quot;enormous amount of information that we have to evaluate, manage&#160; 
&#160; and act upon.&quot;
<br>&#160;
<br> 
&#160; 
&#160; Investigators are concentrating on finding links between the&#160; 
&#160; apparent targets in the bombings, all of whom had at least some&#160; 
&#160; involvement in civil rights issues.
<br>&#160;
<br> 
&#160; 
&#160; The first 
Bomb exploded Saturday in the home of U.S. 11th Circuit&#160; 
&#160; Judge 
<strong>Robert Vance,</strong> killing the 58-year-old jurist and seriously&#160; 
&#160; injuring his wife.&#160;Robert Robinson, 42, a Savannah alderman and lawyer&#160; 
&#160; for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, was&#160; 
&#160; killed Monday when he opened a package at his office.
<br>&#160;
<br> 
&#160; 
&#160; A 
Bomb mailed to the federal appeals court in Atlanta was detected&#160; 
&#160; and disarmed Monday.&#160;Another, addressed to the 
NAACP legal staff in&#160; 
&#160; Jacksonville, was disarmed Tuesday.
<br>&#160;
<br> 
&#160; 
&#160; FBI agents have interviewed lawyers associated with cases that had&#160; 
&#160; been before the federal appeals court.&#160;They also have identified four&#160; 
&#160; desegregation cases that went before the court.&#160;Vance was part of a&#160; 
&#160; ruling panel in a case involving desegregation issues in Jacksonville.
<br>&#160;
<br> Robinson was involved in another case, involving desegregation efforts&#160; 
&#160; in Savannah.
<br>&#160;
<br> 
&#160; 
&#160; Investigators also are looking at a case in which black plaintiffs&#160; 
&#160; are to be awarded $ 3.75-million for their claims of employment&#160; 
&#160; discrimination at Warner Robins Air Force Base.
<br>&#160;
<br> 
&#160; 
&#160; At least one of the 
Bomb packages bore a return address of Warner&#160; 
&#160; Robins, a small community 10 miles south of Macon, Ga.&#160; 
&#160; 
&#160; 
&#160; The FBI has said that none of the people identified in the return&#160; 
&#160; addresses is involved in the crimes.&#160;They also have concluded that at&#160; 
&#160; 
least three, and perhaps all, of the 
Bomb parcels were mailed in&#160; 
&#160; central Georgia.
<br>&#160;
<br> 
&#160; 
&#160; The proximity of the mailings has suggested the crimes may be the&#160; 
&#160; work of one person, and not an organized group.
