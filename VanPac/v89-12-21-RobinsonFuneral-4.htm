<strong>BODY:</strong><p class="subheader" align="Left"> 
<br>In Savannah, Ga., about 60 people gathered at St. James AME Church to pay 
tribute to city Alderman Robert Robinson, who was killed by a mail 
Bomb at his law office Monday.
<br><br>Meanwhile, the FBI probed new clues linking the 
<strong>bombs:</strong>
<br><br>- All had Georgia return addresses or postmarks.  

<br><br>- They may be connected to four anonymous letters sent last August declaring 
war on the 11th Circuit Court. A tear-gas canister injured eight people at the 
NAACP's Atlanta office shortly after.
<br><br>The circuit, which includes Georgia, Alabama and Florida and in the 1960s also 
encompassed Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas, was the site of most civil rights 
movement cases. It was ''where most of the confrontations and bloodbaths 
were,'' said NAACP Executive Director Benjamin Hooks.
<br><br>- All are linked to school desegregation efforts.
<br><br>Vance wrote an opinion won by the NAACP against Jacksonville, Fla., schools. 
Robinson represented the NAACP in a separate case.
<br><br>The 11th Circuit's headquarters in Atlanta and the Jacksonville NAACP 
headquarters also received 
bombs this week. Both were disarmed.
<br><br>While black leaders said the mail 
bombs renewed their determination, Hooks said the 
bombs are ''something brand new.'' Instead of attacks on churches and homes, ''This 
new breed of terrorist strikes through the mail. ... it is so randomly 
directed.''
