<br> A portrait of a suspect in the mail-Bomb slayings of a federal judge and civil rights lawyer is beginning to emerge.
<br><br>The Birmingham Post-Herald said Thursday the FBI believes the bomber is an 
elderly white man who is very religious or has legal experience.  

<br><br>A psychologist says the bomber is mentally ill, may have Alzheimer's, may have 
been a minor crime victim.
<br><br>Judge 
<strong>Robert Vance</strong> of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was killed Dec. 16 by a mail 
Bomb at his Mountain Brook, Ala., home. On Dec. 18, civil rights lawyer Robert 
Robinson was killed by a 
Bomb in Savannah, Ga. Other 
bombs were found in Atlanta's 11th Circuit courthouse, the Jacksonville, Fla., NAACP 
office.
<br><br>The FBI believes the bomber is elderly because:
<br><br>- He used 3-cent stamps, which are no longer sold, to send the packages.
<br><br>- He used an old-fashioned method to wrap the packages - brown butcher's paper 
and baker's string.
<br><br>The FBI, the newspaper said, thinks he is religious or has a legal background 
because he used ''shall,'' a word common in Scriptures and 
legal books, several times.
<br><br>FBI agent Tom Moore declined to comment.
<br><br>University of Southern California psychologist Alfred Coodley says an elderly 
bomber may have the beginnings Alzheimer's, allowing him to accept irrational 
beliefs.
<br><br>His actions may have been triggered, says Coodley, by involvement in a case 
such as a traffic fine, or by being the victim of a minor crime.
