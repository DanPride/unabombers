<br>TAINTING EVIDENCE
<br> Inside the Scandals
<br> at the FBI Crime Lab.
<br> By John F. Kelly
<br> and Phillip K. Wearne.
<br> 355 pp. New York:
<br> The Free Press. $25.  

<br><br> Like a lot of myths about the F.B.I., the image of its criminal laboratory as 
a cutting-edge forensic unit has frayed rather badly in recent years, as 
internal Justice Department investigations disclosed problems ranging from 
sloppy evidence handling to doctored reports. In 
&quot;Tainting Evidence,&quot; John F. Kelly and Phillip K. Wearne continue the assault, showing how the 
lab's ineptitude played out in a series of high-profile cases like the bombings 
at the World Trade Center and the Oklahoma City Federal Building and the mail 
Bomb assassination of 
<strong>Robert Vance,</strong> a Federal appeals court judge.
<br><br>Kelly, who was the principal investigator for 
&quot;The Bureau,&quot; a 1995 PBS television series, and Wearne, a freelance journalist based in 
London and Brussels, make Frederic Whitehurst, a chemist at the 
F.B.I. lab, their protagonist. They portray top Federal Bureau of Investigation 
managers as creaky bureaucrats who turned on Whitehurst. He had been showering 
them for years with memos complaining about the lab and examiners who worked 
there. His superiors greeted his criticisms with shrugs of complacency -- and 
then a demotion in the form of a transfer. In the end, Whitehurst's 
whistle-blowing worked: it was largely responsible for forcing the Justice 
Department to investigate the lab. After an 18-month inquiry, however, in April 
1997 the department's inspector general issued a 517-page report dismissing 
Whitehurst's charges that lab examiners fabricated testimony, but confirming 
important allegations of testimonial errors, substandard analytical work and 
poor practices at the lab's chemistry-toxicology, explosives and material 
analysis units.
<br><br>Kelly and Wearne revisit many of Whitehurst's complaints, asserting that the 
inspector general's report was too narrow -- though in more than one instance, 
incidents the inspector general cited and the book relates make the lab sleuths 
seem better fodder for a sitcom than a detective story. Take the time the 
principal examiner of the explosion at the Oklahoma Federal Building turned 
forensic science on its head, determining the weight of the 
Bomb to be 4,000 pounds not by scientific analysis but by working backward, 
calculating its weight by the receipts for fertilizer found on the property of 
one of the suspects. Nevertheless, 
&quot;Tainting Evidence&quot; sounds one-sided, a problem exacerbated by the F.B.I.'s unwillingness to 
respond to the authors' inquiries and requests for information, on grounds that 
are not clear from the book, although it seems apparent that F.B.I. officials 
may have doubted their objectivity.
<br><br>The inspector general's 
inquiry caused an upheaval at the lab. It forced law enforcement officials to 
overhaul procedures, hire a director with a science background and seek 
professional accreditation of the lab for the first time. The F.B.I., adept at 
handling Congress, turned its embarrassment into a budget increase, wresting 
money from lawmakers to construct a new lab at its training base in Quantico, 
Va. (The lab is currently located at headquarters in Washington.)
<br><br>STILL, the authors overstate the lab's failures as a shocking breakdown of the 
criminal justice system. The inadequacies of the lab, while serious, have not 
produced the chaos predicted by defense lawyers. The disclosures about lab 
work, they said, would topple scores of criminal convictions, raise doubts 
about the truthfulness of forensic evidence in hundreds of other cases and turn 
dangerous felons 
loose on the streets.
<br><br>As Oklahoma City shows, sloppy lab work does not necessarily mean that the 
F.B.I. and the Justice Department have thrown innocent people into prison. With 
cooperating witnesses testifying against them, Terry Nichols and Timothy 
McVeigh faced long odds against escaping conviction. And a year after the 
report, only a handful of defendants have sought to overturn their convictions; 
so far no guilty verdicts have been reversed.
