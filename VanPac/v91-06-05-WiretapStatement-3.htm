<br> Walter Leroy Moody Jr. went on trial Tuesday in what a prosecutor called the 
racially motivated mail-Bomb deaths of a federal judge and a civil rights lawyer.
<br><br>Prosecutor Howard Shapiro told the 12 jurors and four alternates, including one 
black, that Moody's failure to get a 1972 
Bomb conviction overturned triggered in him a hatred for blacks, whom he saw as 
able to get action in court.
<br><br>''As the details are pieced together, you will hear the story of one man 
responsible for the awful and awesome carnage,'' Shapiro said in opening 
arguments.  

<br><br>Moody, 57, of Rex, Ga., is charged with the 1989 deaths of 11th U.S. Circuit 
Court Judge 
<strong>Robert Vance</strong> of Mountain Brook, Ala., and civil rights lawyer Robert Robinson, an alderman 
in Savannah, Ga.
<br><br>''He saw Vance and Robinson as part of a system that guaranteed rights for some 
while denying others,'' Shapiro said. ''He saw the NAACP as enforcing double 
standards.''
<br><br>Vance was targeted because ''he championed black civil rights'' in his rulings 
and Robinson because he did civil rights legal work, Shapiro said.
<br><br>Vance, who was white, was killed Dec. 16, 1989, by a package mailed to his 
home. Robinson, who was black, died two days later after opening a package sent 
to his office.
<br><br>A 71-count indictment also charges Moody with injuring Vance's wife, Helen, and 
mailing threats to 17 
federal judges in Georgia, Alabama and Florida, 
bombs to NAACP offices in the South and death threats to civil rights officials.
<br><br>If convicted, Moody faces up to life in prison.
<br><br>The prosecution's case includes letters sent to judges reading in part: 
''Judge: Americans for a Competent Federal Judicial System shall assassinate 
you because of the federal court's calloused disregard for the administration 
of justice.''
<br><br>Defense lawyer Edward Tolley said in his opening statement that there were 
significant flaws in the government's case, including that no witness would 
testify to having seen Moody mail 
Bomb packages.
<br><br>The trial was moved after all federal judges in the 11th Circuit - Alabama, 
Georgia and Florida - disqualified themselves and the defense argued Moody 
couldn't get a fair trial in the South.
<br><br>The trial is being conducted under tight 
security - newly installed metal detectors at courthouse entrances and a 
bolstered U.S. marshals staff including sharpshooters on the courthouse roof. 
No threats have been received.
<br><br>Moody was diagnosed in 1967 with psychiatric problems, Tolley confirmed before 
the trial began. Tolley also said before the trial that he urged Moody to plead 
insanity, but Moody wouldn't.
<br><br>''He sees insanity as an admission of guilt,'' the lawyer says.
<br><br>Moody, a literary agent, became a suspect in January 1990 after investigators 
noticed similarities between the mail 
bombs and a 
Bomb he was convicted of possessing in 1972. The failure to get that conviction 
overturned is what led to his frustration and mail-Bomb attacks, Shapiro said.
<br><br>Investigators were led to a Chamblee, Ga., house where Moody stored belongings, 
and found what they call a prototype of the 1989 
bombs.
<br><br>Eventually, 
agents wiretapped Moody's home and cars. According to court documents, the 
wiretapping revealed Moody whispering to himself, ''Now you've killed two 
people. Now you can't pull another bombing.''
<br><br>Before Moody's indictment, the investigation focused on Enterprise, Ala., junk 
dealer Wayne O'Ferrell after the typing on threatening letters reportedly 
matched a typewriter owned by O'Ferrell.
<br><br>Under news media scrutiny, the FBI interviewed O'Ferrell, searched a lake on 
his property and confiscated numerous items from his warehouse. He has since 
been cleared.
