<br>

<strong>SOURCE:</strong> Compiled from Wire Reports

<strong>BODY:</strong><p class="subheader" align="Left"> 
<br>A Maryland state judge was injured Friday when an explosive device 
 blew up in his home, prompting state and federal investigations to 
 question whether the blast is linked to a recent rash of package-Bomb 
 incidents in the southeastern United States.
<br>
<br> 
 
 Judge John P. Corderman, 47, of the Washington County Circuit, was 
 in stable condition at Washington County Hospital Friday night after 
 the 
Bomb detonated in his Hagerstown home at about 2:30 p.m. 
 

<br>
<br> 
 
A hospital spokeswoman, Diana Donegon, said the judge had undergone 
 surgery to remove fragments from his stomach, abdomen and right hand.
<br>
<br> She said he also suffered damage to his eardrums but had not lost 
 consciousness.His life was 
&quot;in no immediate danger.&quot; 

<br>
<br> 
 
 Surgeon Charles Chaney said Corderman had the package in his lap 
 when it exploded. 
&quot;It was a life-threatening 
<strong>bomb,</strong>&quot; Chaney said. 
&quot;It 
 was not of small proportions.&quot;
<br>
<br> 
 
 The judge staggered to an outer hallway and set off a fire alarm, 
 authorities said.  H 
 
 Federal agents quickly joined local authorities in the 
 investigation, although they emphasized that they had no evidence 
 connecting the 
Bomb that injured Corderman with the mail 
bombs that 
 killed a federal appellate court judge near Birmingham, Ala., on 
 Saturday and a lawyer in Savannah, Ga., on Monday.
<br>
<br> 
 
 One federal investigator said there were 
&quot;dissimilarities&quot; 
 between the 
Bomb found Friday and those that have led to the wide 
 
 investigation in the South.
<br>
<br> 
 
 In the Maryland incident, an unexploded pipe 
Bomb was found in the 
 same package as the device that exploded;it was designed to detonate 
 when the 
first one did, said Deputy Fire Marshal Faron Taylor.The 
 building was evacuated and 
Bomb specialists disarmed the second device, 
 he said.
<br>
<br> 
 
 A neighbor, Steven Keyes, 30, said he saw a deliveryman bring a 
 package to the building about 20 minutes before the explosion.
<br>
<br> 
 
 
&quot;It looked like a normal person to me, a normal delivery,&quot; Keyes 
 said.
<br>
<br> 
 
 Corderman, a 12-year member of the bench with a reputation for 
 tough sentencing, was not at work Friday because the courthouse was 
 closed for the Christmas holiday.
<br>
<br> 
 
 Some officials expressed concern that the attack on Corderman might 
 have been work of a person or group attempting to copy the bombings in 
 the South.Investigators said that they had no motive for the attack on 
 Corderman.
<br>
<br> 
 
 
&quot;He's a judge.He's put a lot of people away,&quot; police Lt. Robert 
 
Frick said.
<br>
<br> 
 
 Several friends and colleagues of Corderman's described him as a 
 strict judge who often imposed maximum sentences, especially in drug 
 abuse and alcohol-related cases.
<br>
<br> 
 
 According to Baltimore lawyer Chris Brown, 
&quot;He's the kind of 
 gentleman who you like him or don't like him.He has rubbed people the 
 wrong way.&quot;
<br>
<br> 
 
 Brown said the judge 
&quot;takes unusual stances and gives lawyers a 
 hard time.He's a very colorful outspoken, controversial judge.&quot;
<br>
<br> 
 
 Meanwhile, sources said Friday that colleagues of the Alabama judge 
 have received threatening letters since the judge's death.
<br>
<br> 
 
 The letters were among those that surfaced after parcel 
bombs 
 killed 11th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge 
<strong>Robert Vance</strong> on Saturday and 
 Savannah lawyer Robert Robinson two days later, the sources said.
<br>
<br> 
 
 A letter addressed to Vance was also among those delivered, said 
 the sources, who 
spoke on condition of anonymity.
<br>
<br> 
 
 Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said he was unaware that 
 letters had been delivered to judges on the 11th Circuit.
<br>
<br> 
 
 But he said there was 
&quot;solid evidence&quot; on four other threatening 
 letters delivered this week linking them to the parcel 
bombs that 
 killed Vance and Robinson as well as to two other 
bombs found this 
 week.
<br>
<br> 
 
 Robinson's funeral is to be held today in Savannah.
<br>
<br> 
 
 Parcel 
bombs were also found at the Jacksonville chapter of the 
 NAACP and the 11th Circuit courthouse in Atlanta.Both were disarmed.
<br>
<br> 
 
 Runkel declined to describe the common characteristics of the 
 letters and the parcel 
bombs, but said the physical evidence may also 
 provide a link to letters sent in August that declared war on the 11th 
 Circuit.
<br>
<br> 
 
 The earlier letters, sent from Atlanta, threatened poison gas 
 attacks on population centers until 
&quot;widespread terror&quot; forced the 
 
11th Circuit to 
&quot;adopt the impartial and equitable treatment of all.&quot;
