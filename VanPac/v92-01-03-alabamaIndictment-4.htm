<br>Montgomery - An Alabama grand jury indicted Walter Leroy Moody Jr.&#160;on capital murder charges in the 1989 mail-Bomb slaying of a federal&#160;judge at his suburban Birmingham home, a prosecutor said Thursday.
<br><br>Assistant State Attorney General David Vickers said Moody, 58, of&#160;Rex, Ga., was indicted by a Jefferson County grand jury on one count of&#160;capital murder by means of an explosive and one count of killing a&#160;federal official.
<br><br>If convicted of capital murder in Alabama, Moody could be sentenced&#160;to death in the state's electric chair or to life in prison without&#160;parole.  

<br><br>Moody was accused of mailing the packaged explosive that detonated&#160;and killed 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge 
<strong>Robert Vance</strong> at his&#160;Mountain Brook home Dec. 16, 1989.
<br><br>Mr. Vickers said the grand jury also indicted Moody on a charge of&#160;assault on the judge's wife, Helen Vance, who was injured when the&#160;package exploded as the judge opened it.
<br><br>Moody was convicted last year on 71 federal counts in the mail-Bomb&#160;killings of Judge Vance and Robert E. Robinson, a Savannah, Ga., city&#160;alderman and civil rights lawyer, who was slain when a package exploded&#160;two days after Judge Vance's death. Moody is serving seven life terms&#160;plus 400 years on the federal convictions.
<br><br>Mr. Vickers said Moody is serving the federal sentence at 
a prison&#160;in Illinois and that a request for extradition to Alabama would be made.&#160;Moody could be brought to Alabama for arraignment in 60 days.
<br><br>State Attorney General Jimmy Evans, who pursued the capital murder&#160;charge after Moody's federal conviction last year, has said the&#160;circumstances in the slaying of the federal judge warrant a sentence of&#160;death. Prosecutors in Georgia also have said they would seek the death&#160;penalty in Mr. Robinson's slaying.
<br><br>The Atlanta-based 11th Circuit, on which Judge Vance served, has&#160;jurisdiction over federal appeals in Alabama, Georgia and Florida. The&#160;federal trial of Moody was moved to Minnesota to make sure his rights to&#160;a fair trial were not infringed.
<br><br>State prosecutors have said defense lawyers similarly may seek to&#160;move any capital murder trial of Moody away from Alabama.
