      when I return to Cambridge, reminiscing about the old days and musing on 
      how different my life has been from what I hoped and expected then. On a 
      trip there last fall I found myself a few blocks north of Harvard Yard, on 
      Divinity Avenue. Near the end of this dead-end street sits the Peabody 
      Museum -- a giant Victorian structure attached to the Botanical Museum, 
      where my mother had taken me as a young boy, in 1943, to view the 
      spectacular exhibit of glass flowers. These left such a vivid impression 
      that a decade later my recollection of them inspired me, then a senior in 
      high school, to apply to Harvard. </P></TD></TR>

    <TD vAlign=top align=left width=380><a name="Patents"></a>This time my return was prompted not 
      by nostalgia but by curiosity. No. 7 Divinity Avenue is a modern 
      multi-story academic building today, housing the university's Department 
      of Molecular and Cellular Biology. In 1959 a comfortable old house stood 
      on the site. Known as the Annex, it served as a laboratory in which staff 
      members of the Department of Social Relations conducted research on human 
      subjects. <a href="index.html#Patents">There, from the fall of 1959 
      through the spring of 1962, Harvard 
      psychologists, led by Henry A. Murray, conducted a disturbing and what 
      would now be seen as ethically indefensible experiment on twenty-two 
      undergraduates. To preserve the anonymity of these student guinea pigs, 
      experimenters referred to individuals by code name only. One of these 
      students, whom they dubbed "Lawful," was Theodore John Kaczynski, who 
      would one day be known as the Unabomber, and who would later mail or 
      deliver sixteen package bombs to scientists, academicians, and others over 
      seventeen years, killing three people and injuring twenty-three. </a>
      <P><IMG alt=I hspace=0 src="images/MKUltraInvoices_files/i-small.gif" align=left width="25" height="44"> 
      HAD a special interest in Kaczynski. For many years he and I had lived 
      parallel lives to some degree. Both of us had attended public high schools 
      and had then gone on to Harvard, from which I graduated in 1957, he in 
      1962. At Harvard we took many of the same courses from the same 
      professors. We were both graduate students and assistant professors in the 
      1960s. I studied at Oxford and received a Ph.D. in philosophy from 
      Princeton before joining the faculty at Ohio State and later serving as 
      chairman of the Department of Philosophy at Macalester College, in 
      Minnesota. Kaczynski earned a Ph.D. in mathematics at the University of 
      Michigan in 1967 and then joined the Berkeley Department of Mathematics as 
      an instructor. In the early 1970s, at roughly the same time, we separately 
      fled civilization to the Montana wilderness. 
      <P>In 1971 Kaczynski moved to Great Falls, Montana; that summer he began 
      building a cabin near the town of Lincoln, eighty miles southwest of Great 
      Falls, on a lot he and his brother, David, had bought. In 1972 my wife and 
      I bought an old homestead fifty-five miles south of Great Falls. Three 
      years later we gave up our teaching jobs to live in Montana full-time. Our 
      place had neither telephone nor electricity; it was ten miles from the 
      nearest neighbor. In winter we were snowbound for months at a time. 
      <P>In our desire to leave civilization Kaczynski and I were not alone. 
      Many others sought a similar escape. What, I wondered, had driven 
      Kaczynski into the wilderness, and to murder? To what degree were his 
      motives simply a more extreme form of the alienation that prompted so many 
      of us to seek solace in the backwoods? 
      <P>Most of us may believe we already know Ted Kaczynski. According to the 
      conventional wisdom, Kaczynski, a brilliant former professor of 
      mathematics turned Montana hermit and mail bomber, is, simply, mentally 
      ill. He is a paranoid schizophrenic, and there is nothing more about him 
      to interest us. But the conventional wisdom is mistaken. I came to 
      discover that Kaczynski is neither the extreme loner he has been made out 
      to be nor in any clinical sense mentally ill. He is an intellectual and a 
      convicted murderer, and to understand the connections between these two 
      facts we must revisit his time at Harvard. 
      <P>I first heard of the Murray experiment from Kaczynski himself. We had 
      begun corresponding in July of 1998, a couple of months after a federal 
      court in Sacramento sentenced him to life without possibility of parole. 
      Kaczynski, I quickly discovered, was an indefatigable correspondent. 
      Sometimes his letters to me came so fast that it was difficult to answer 
      one before the next arrived. The letters were written with great humor, 
      intelligence, and care. And, I found, he was in his own way a charming 
      correspondent. He has apparently carried on a similarly voluminous 
      correspondence with many others, often developing close friendships with 
      them through the mail. </P></TD></TR>

</TD>
    <TD vAlign=top align=left width=380>Kaczynski told me that the <A 
      target=outlink href="http://www.radcliffe.edu/murray/">Henry A. Murray 
      Research Center</A> of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, 
      although it released some raw data about him to his attorneys, had refused 
      to share information about the Murray team's analysis of that data. 
      Kaczynski hinted darkly that the Murray Center seemed to feel it had 
      something to hide. One of his defense investigators, he said, reported 
      that the center had told participating psychologists not to talk with his 
      defense team. 
      <P>After this intriguing start Kaczynski told me little more about the 
      Murray experiment than what I could find in the published literature. 
      Henry Murray's widow, Nina, was friendly and cooperative, but could 
      provide few answers to my questions. Several of the research assistants I 
      interviewed couldn't, or wouldn't, talk much about the study. Nor could 
      the Murray Center be entirely forthcoming. After considering my 
      application, its research committee approved my request to view the 
      records of this experiment, the so-called data set, which referred to 
      subjects by code names only. But because Kaczynski's alias was by then 
      known to some journalists, I was not permitted to view his records. 
      <P>Through research at the Murray Center and in the Harvard archives I 
      found that, among its other purposes, Henry Murray's experiment was 
      intended to measure how people react under stress. Murray subjected his 
      unwitting students, including Kaczynski, to intensive interrogation -- 
      what Murray himself called "vehement, sweeping, and personally abusive" 
      attacks, assaulting his subjects' egos and most-cherished ideals and 
      beliefs. 
      <P>My quest was specific -- to determine what effects, if any, the 
      experiment may have had on Kaczynski. This was a subset of a larger 
      question: What effects had Harvard had on Kaczynski? In 1998, as he faced 
      trial for murder, Kaczynski was examined by Sally Johnson, a forensic 
      psychiatrist with the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, at the order of a court. In 
      her evaluation Johnson wrote that Kaczynski "has intertwined his two 
      belief systems, that society is bad and he should rebel against it, and 
      his intense anger at his family for his perceived injustices." The 
      Unabomber was created when these two belief systems converged. And it was 
      at Harvard, Johnson suggested, that they first surfaced and met. She 
      wrote, 
      <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>During his college years he had fantasies of 
        living a primitive life and fantasized himself as "an agitator, rousing 
        mobs to frenzies of revolutionary violence." He claims that during that 
        time he started to think about breaking away from normal 
      society.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>It was at Harvard that Kaczynski first encountered the ideas about the 
      evils of society that would provide a justification for and a focus to an 
      anger he had felt since junior high school. It was at Harvard that he 
      began to develop these ideas into his anti-technology ideology of 
      revolution. It was at Harvard that Kaczynski began to have fantasies of 
      revenge, began to dream of escaping into wilderness. And it was at 
      Harvard, as far as can be determined, that he fixed on dualistic ideas of 
      good and evil, and on a mathematical cognitive style that led him to think 
      he could find absolute truth through the application of his own reason. 
      Was the Unabomber -- "the most intellectual serial killer the nation has 
      ever produced," as one criminologist has called him -- born at Harvard?

      <IMG alt=T hspace=0 src="images/MKUltraInvoices_files/t-small.gif" 
      align=left width="37" height="44">HE story of Kaczynski's crimes began more than twenty-two years 
      ago, but the chain of consequences they triggered has yet to run its 
      course. Dubbed "the Unabomber" by the FBI because his early victims were 
      associated with <I>un</I>iversities or <I>a</I>irlines, Kaczynski 
      conducted an increasingly lethal campaign of terrorism that began on May 
      26, 1978, when his first bomb slightly injured a Northwestern University 
      public-safety officer, Terry Marker, and ended on April 24, 1995, when a 
      bomb he had mailed killed the president of the California Forestry 
      Association, Gilbert Murray. Yet until 1993 Kaczynski remained mute, and 
      his intentions were entirely unknown. 
      <P>By 1995 his explosives had taken a leap in sophistication; that year he 
      suddenly became loquacious, writing letters to newspapers, magazines, 
      targets, and a victim. Two years later <I>The Washington Post,</I> in 
      conjunction with <I>The New York Times,</I> published copies of the 
      35,000-word essay that Kaczynski titled <A target=outlink 
      href="http://www.unabombertrial.com/manifesto/index.html">"Industrial 
      Society and Its Future,"</A> and which the press called "The Manifesto." 
      <P>Recognizing the manifesto as Kaczynski's writing, his brother, David, 
      turned Kaczynski in to the FBI, which arrested him at his Montana cabin on 
      April 3, 1996. Later that year Kaczynski was removed to California to 
      stand trial for, among other crimes, two Unabomber murders committed in 
      that state. On January 8, 1998, having failed to dissuade his attorneys 
      from their intention of presenting an insanity defense, and having failed 
      to persuade the presiding judge, Garland E. Burrell Jr., to allow him to 
      choose a new attorney, Kaczynski asked the court for permission to 
      represent himself. In response Burrell ordered Sally Johnson to examine 
      Kaczynski, to determine if he was competent to direct his own defense. 
      Johnson offered a "provisional" diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia, but 
      she concluded that Kaczynski was nevertheless competent to represent 
      himself. Burrell refused to allow it. Faced with the prospect of a 
      humiliating trial in which his attorneys would portray him as insane and 
      his philosophy as the ravings of a madman, Kaczynski capitulated: in 
      exchange for the government's agreement not to seek the death penalty, he 
      pleaded guilty to thirteen federal bombing offenses that killed three men 
      and seriously injured two others, and acknowledged responsibility for 
      sixteen bombings from 1978 to 1995. On May 4, 1998, he was sentenced to 
      life in prison without possibility of parole. 
      <P>Driving these events from first bomb to plea bargain was Kaczynski's 
      strong desire to have his ideas -- as described in the manifesto -- taken 
      seriously. 
      <P>"The Industrial Revolution and its consequences," Kaczynski's manifesto 
      begins, "have been a disaster for the human race." They have led, it 
      contends, to the growth of a technological system dependent on a social, 
      economic, and political order that suppresses individual freedom and 
      destroys nature. "The system does not and cannot exist to satisfy human 
      needs. Instead, it is human behavior that has to be modified to fit the 
      needs of the system." 
      <P>By forcing people to conform to machines rather than vice versa, the 
      manifesto states, technology creates a sick society hostile to human 
      potential. Because technology demands constant change, it destroys local, 
      human-scale communities. Because it requires a high degree of social and 
      economic organization, it encourages the growth of crowded and unlivable 
      cities and of mega-states indifferent to the needs of citizens. 
      <P>This evolution toward a civilization increasingly dominated by 
      technology and the power structure serving technology, the manifesto 
      argues, cannot be reversed on its own, because "technology is a more 
      powerful social force than the aspiration for freedom," and because "while 
      technological progress <FONT size=2>AS A WHOLE</FONT> continually narrows 
      our sphere of freedom, each new technical advance <FONT size=2>CONSIDERED 
      BY ITSELF</FONT> appears to be desirable." Hence science and technology 
      constitute "a mass power movement, and many scientists gratify their need 
      for power through identification with this mass movement." Therefore "the 
      technophiles are taking us all on an utterly reckless ride into the 
      unknown." 
      <P>Because human beings must conform to the machine, 
      <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>our society tends to regard as a "sickness" any 
        mode of thought or behavior that is inconvenient for the system, and 
        this is plausible because when an individual doesn't fit into the system 
        it causes pain to the individual as well as problems for the system. 
        Thus the manipulation of an individual to adjust him to the system is 
        seen as a "cure" for a "sickness" and therefore as 
      good.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>This requirement, the manifesto continues, has given rise to a social 
      infrastructure dedicated to modifying behavior. This infrastructure 
      includes an array of government agencies with ever-expanding police 
      powers, an out-of-control regulatory system that encourages the limitless 
      multiplication of laws, an education establishment that stresses 
      conformism, ubiquitous television networks whose fare is essentially an 
      electronic form of Valium, and a medical and psychological establishment 
      that promotes the indiscriminate use of mind-altering drugs. </P></TD></TR>

</TD>
    <TD vAlign=top align=left width=380>Since the system threatens humanity's 
      survival and cannot be reformed, Kaczynski argued, it must be destroyed. 
      Indeed, the system will probably collapse on its own, when the weight of 
      human suffering it creates becomes unbearable. But the longer it persists, 
      the more devastating will be the ultimate collapse. Hence 
      "revolutionaries" like the Unabomber "by hastening the onset of the 
      breakdown will be reducing the extent of the disaster." 
      <P>"We have no illusions about the feasibility of creating a new, ideal 
      form of society," Kaczynski wrote. "Our goal is only to destroy the 
      existing form of society." But this movement does have a further goal. It 
      is to protect "wild nature," which is the opposite of technology. 
      Admittedly, "eliminating industrial society" may have some "negative 
      consequences," but "well, you can't eat your cake and have it too."

      align=left width="37" height="44">HE Unabomber's manifesto was greeted in 1995 by many thoughtful 
      people as a work of genius, or at least profundity, and as quite sane. In 
      <I>The New York Times</I> the environmental writer Kirkpatrick Sale wrote 
      that the Unabomber "is a rational man and his principal beliefs are, if 
      hardly mainstream, entirely reasonable." In <I>The Nation</I> Sale 
      declared that the manifesto's first sentence "is absolutely crucial for 
      the American public to understand and ought to be on the forefront of the 
      nation's political agenda." The science writer Robert Wright observed in 
      <I>Time</I> magazine, "There's a little bit of the unabomber in most of 
      us." An essay in <I>The New Yorker</I> by Cynthia Ozick described the 
      Unabomber as America's "own Raskolnikov -- the appealing, appalling, and 
      disturbingly visionary murderer of 'Crime and Punishment,' Dostoyevsky's 
      masterwork of 1866." Ozick called the Unabomber a "philosophical criminal 
      of exceptional intelligence and humanitarian purpose, who is driven to 
      commit murder out of an uncompromising idealism." Sites devoted to the 
      Unabomber multiplied on the Internet -- the <A target=outlink 
      href="http://www.churchofeuthanasia.org/resources/fc/fc.html">Church of 
      Euthanasia Freedom Club</A>; <A target=outlink 
      href="http://www.unabombers.html">Unapack, the 
      Unabomber Political Action Committee</A>; alt.fan.unabomber; Chuck's 
      Unabomb Page; <A target=outlink 
      href="http://www.redacted.com/">redacted.com</A>; MetroActive; and Steve 
      Hau's Rest Stop. The University of Colorado hosted a panel titled "The 
      Unabomber Had a Point." 
      <P>By 1997, however, when Kaczynski's trial opened, the view had shifted. 
      Although psychiatrists for the prosecution continued to cite the manifesto 
      as proof of Kaczynski's sanity, experts for the defense and many in the 
      media now viewed it as a symptom and a product of severe mental illness. 
      The document, they argued, revealed a paranoid mind. During the trial the 
      press frequently quoted legal experts who attested to Kaczynski's 
      insanity. Gerald Lefcourt, then the president of the National Association 
      of Criminal Defense Lawyers, said the defendant was "obviously disturbed." 
      Donald Heller, a former federal prosecutor, said, "This guy is not playing 
      with a full deck." The writer Maggie Scarf suggested in <I>The New 
      Republic</I> that Kaczynski suffered from "Narcissistic Personality 
      Disorder." 
      <P>Michael Mello, a professor at Vermont Law School, is the author of <A 
      target=outlink 
      href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=1893956016/theatlanticmonthA/"><I>The 
      United States of America vs. Theodore John Kaczynski.</I></A> He and 
      William Finnegan, a writer for <I>The New Yorker,</I> have suggested that 
      Kaczynski's brother, David, his mother, Wanda, and their lawyer, Tony 
      Bisceglie, along with Kaczynski's defense attorneys, persuaded many in the 
      media to portray Kaczynski as a paranoid schizophrenic. To a degree this 
      is true. Anxious to save Kaczynski from execution, David and Wanda gave a 
      succession of interviews from 1996 onward to <I>The Washington Post, The 
      New York Times,</I> and <I>Sixty Minutes,</I> among other outlets, in 
      which they sought to portray Kaczynski as mentally disturbed and 
      pathologically antisocial since childhood. Meanwhile -- against his wishes 
      and without his knowledge, Kaczynski insists -- his attorneys launched a 
      mental-health defense for their client. 
      <P>One psychology expert for the defense, Karen Bronk Froming, concluded 
      that Kaczynski exhibited a "predisposition to schizophrenia." Another, 
      David Vernon Foster, saw "a clear and consistent picture of schizophrenia, 
      paranoid type." Still another, Xavier F.&nbsp;Amador, described Kaczynski 
      as "typical of the hundreds of patients with schizophrenia." How did the 
      experts reach their conclusions? Although objective tests alone suggested 
      to Froming only that Kaczynski's answers were "consistent with" 
      schizophrenia, she told Finnegan it was Kaczynski's writings -- in 
      particular his "anti-technology" views -- that cemented this conclusion 
      for her. Foster, who met with Kaczynski a few times but never formally 
      examined him, cited his "delusional themes" as evidence of sickness. 
      Amador, who never met Kaczynski at all, based his judgment on the 
      "delusional beliefs" he detected in Kaczynski's writing. And Sally 
      Johnson's provisional diagnosis -- that Kaczynski suffered from "Paranoid 
      Type" schizophrenia -- was largely based on her conviction that he 
      harbored "delusional beliefs" about the threats posed by technology. The 
      experts also found evidence of Kaczynski's insanity in his refusal to 
      accept their diagnoses or to help them reach those diagnoses. 
      <P>Most claims of mental illness rested on the diagnoses of experts whose 
      judgments, therefore, derived largely from their opinions of Kaczynski's 
      philosophy and his personal habits -- he was a recluse, a wild man in 
      appearance, a slob of a housekeeper, a celibate -- and from his refusal to 
      admit he was ill. Thus Froming cited Kaczynski's "unawareness of his 
      disease" as an indication of illness. Foster complained of the defendant's 
      "symptom-based failure to cooperate fully with psychiatric evaluation." 
      Amador said that the defendant suffered "from severe deficits in awareness 
      of illness." 
      <P>But Kaczynski was no more unkempt than many other people on our 
      streets. His cabin was no messier than the offices of many college 
      professors. The Montana wilds are filled with escapists like Kaczynski 
      (and me). Celibacy and misanthropy are not diseases. Nor was Kaczynski 
      really so much of a recluse. Any reporter could quickly discover, as I did 
      through interviews with scores of people who have known Kaczynski 
      (classmates, teachers, neighbors), that he was not the extreme loner he 
      has been made out to be. And, surely, a refusal to admit to being insane 
      or to cooperate with people who are paid to pronounce one insane cannot be 
      taken seriously as proof of insanity. 
      <P>Why were the media and the public so ready to dismiss Kaczynski as 
      crazy? Kaczynski kept voluminous journals, and in one entry, apparently 
      from before the bombing started, he anticipated this question. 
      <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>I intend to start killing people. If I am 
        successful at this, it is possible that, when I am caught (not alive, I 
        fervently hope!) there will be some speculation in the news media as to 
        my motives for killing.... If some speculation occurs, they are bound to 
        make me out to be a sickie, and to ascribe to me motives of a sordid or 
        "sick" type. Of course, the term "sick" in such a context represents a 
        value judgment.... the news media may have something to say about me 
        when I am killed or caught. And they are bound to try to analyse my 
        psychology and depict me as "sick." This powerful bias should be borne 
        [in mind] in reading any attempts to analyse my 
      psychology.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Michael Mello suggests that the public wished to see Kaczynski as 
      insane because his ideas are too extreme for us to contemplate without 
      discomfort. He challenges our most cherished beliefs. Mello writes, 
      <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>The manifesto challenges the basic assumptions 
        of virtually every interest group that was involved with the case: the 
        lawyers, the mental health experts, the press and politics -- both left 
        and right.... Kaczynski's defense team convinced the media and the 
        public that Kaczynski was crazy, even in the absence of credible 
        evidence ... [because] we needed to believe it.... They decided that the 
        Unabomber was mentally ill, and his ideas were mad. Then they forgot 
        about the man and his ideas, and created a curative 
      tale.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Mello is only half right. It is true that many believed Kaczynski was 
      insane because they needed to believe it. But the truly disturbing aspect 
      of Kaczynski and his ideas is not that they are so foreign but that they 
      are so familiar. The manifesto is the work of neither a genius nor a 
      maniac. Except for its call to violence, the ideas it expresses are 
      perfectly ordinary and unoriginal, shared by many Americans. Its pessimism 
      over the direction of civilization and its rejection of the modern world 
      are shared especially with the country's most highly educated. The 
      manifesto is, in other words, an academic -- and popular -- cliché. And if 
      concepts that many of us unreflectively accept can lead a person to commit 
      serial murder, what does that say about us? We need to see Kaczynski as 
      exceptional -- madman or genius -- because the alternative is so much more 
      frightening.

      align=left width="37" height="44">O. 8 Prescott Street in Cambridge is a well-preserved 
      three-story Victorian frame house, standing just outside Harvard Yard. 
      Today it houses Harvard's expository-writing program. But in September of 
      1958, when Ted Kaczynski, just sixteen, arrived at Harvard, 8 Prescott 
      Street was a more unusual place, a sort of incubator. </P></TD></TR>

</TD>
    <TD vAlign=top align=left width=380>Earlier that year F. Skiddy von Stade 
      Jr., Harvard's dean of freshmen, had decided to use the house as living 
      accommodations for the brightest, youngest freshmen. Von Stade's 
      well-intentioned idea was to provide these boys with a nurturing, intimate 
      environment, so that they wouldn't feel lost, as they might in the larger, 
      less personal dorms. But in so doing he isolated the overly studious and 
      less-mature boys from their classmates. He inadvertently created a ghetto 
      for grinds, making social adjustment for them more, rather than less, 
      difficult. 
      <P>"I lived at Prescott Street that year too," Michael Stucki told me 
      recently. "And like Kaczynski, I was majoring in mathematics. Yet I swear 
      I never ever even saw the guy." Stucki, who recently retired after a 
      career in computers, lived alone on the top floor, far from Kaczynski's 
      ground-floor room. In the unsocial society of 8 Prescott, that was a big 
      distance. "It was not unusual to spend all one's time in one's room and 
      then rush out the door to library or class," Stucki said. 
      <P>Francis Murphy, the Prescott Street proctor, was a graduate student who 
      had studied for the Catholic priesthood, and to Kaczynski it seemed the 
      house was intended to be run more like a monastery than a dorm. Whereas 
      other freshmen lived in suites with one or two roommates, six of the 
      sixteen students of Prescott Street, including Kaczynski, lived in single 
      rooms. All but seven intended to major in a mathematical science. All but 
      three came from high schools outside New England, and therefore knew few 
      people in Massachusetts. They were, in Murphy's words, "a serious, quiet 
      bunch." 
      <P>Much has been made of Kaczynski's being a "loner" and of his having 
      been further isolated by Harvard's famed snobbism. Snobbism was indeed 
      pervasive at Harvard back then. A single false sartorial step could brand 
      one an outcast. And Kaczynski looked shabby. He owned just two pairs of 
      slacks and only a few shirts. Although he washed these each week in the 
      coin-operated machine in the basement of the house next door to 8 
      Prescott, they became increasingly ragtag. 
      <P>But it is a mistake to exaggerate Kaczynski's isolation. Most public 
      high schoolers at Harvard in those days, including Kaczynski, viewed the 
      tweedy in-crowd as so many buttoned-down buffoons who did not realize how 
      ridiculous they looked. And the evidence is that Kaczynski was neither 
      exceptionally a loner nor, at least in his early years at Harvard, 
      alienated from the school or his peers. 
      <P>Harvard was a "tremendous thing for me," Kaczynski wrote in an 
      unpublished autobiography that he completed in 1998 and showed to me. "I 
      got something that I had been needing all along without knowing it, 
      namely, hard work requiring self-discipline and strenuous exercise of my 
      abilities. I threw myself into this.... I thrived on it.... Feeling the 
      strength of my own will, I became enthusiastic about will power." 
      <P>Freshmen were required to participate in sports, so Kaczynski took up 
      swimming and then wrestling. He played the trombone, as he had in high 
      school, even joining the Harvard band (which he quit almost as soon as he 
      learned that he would have to attend drill sessions). He played pickup 
      basketball. He made a few friends. One of his housemates, Gerald Burns, 
      remembers sitting with Kaczynski in an all-night cafeteria, arguing about 
      the philosophy of Kant. After Kaczynski's arrest Burns wrote to the 
      anarchist journal <I>Fifth Estate</I> that Kaczynski "was as normal as I 
      am now: it was [just] harder on him because he was much younger than his 
      classmates." And indeed, most reports of his teachers, his academic 
      adviser, his housemaster, and the health-services staff suggest that 
      Kaczynski was in his first year at Harvard entirely balanced, although 
      tending to be a loner. The health-services doctor who interviewed 
      Kaczynski as part of the medical examination Harvard required for all 
      freshmen observed, 
      <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>Good impression created. Attractive, mature for 
        age, relaxed.... Talks easily, fluently and pleasantly.... likes people 
        and gets on well with them. May have many acquaintances but makes his 
        friends carefully. Prefers to be by himself part of the time at least. 
        May be slightly shy.... Essentially a practical and realistic planner 
        and an efficient worker.... Exceedingly stable, well integrated and 
        feels secure within himself. Usually very adaptable. May have many 
        achievements and satisfactions.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The doctor further described Kaczynski thus: "Pleasant young man who is 
      below usual college entrance age. Apparently a good mathematician but 
      seems to be gifted in this direction only. Plans not crystallized yet but 
      this is to be expected at his age. Is slightly shy and retiring but not to 
      any abnormal extent. Should be [a] steady worker."
