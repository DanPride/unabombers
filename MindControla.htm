        turns out that Theodore Kaczynski, a.k.a. the Unabomber, was a volunteer
        in mind-control experiments sponsored by the CIA at Harvard in the late
        1950s and early 1960s.</a>

        Michael Mello, author of the recently published book, &quot;The United
        States of America vs. Theodore John Kaczynski,&quot; notes that at some
        point in his Harvard years--1958 to 1962--Kaczynski agreed to be the
        subject of &quot;a psychological experiment.&quot; Mello identifies the
        chief researcher for these only as a lieutenant colonel in World War II,
        working for the CIA's predecessor organization, the Office of Strategic
        Services. In fact, the man experimenting on the young Kaczynski was Dr.
        Henry Murray, who died in 1988.
        <p>Murray became preoccupied by psychoanalysis in the 1920s, drawn to it
        through a fascination with Herman Melville's &quot;Moby Dick,&quot;
        which he gave to Sigmund Freud, who duly made the excited diagnosis that
        the whale was a father figure. After spending the 1930s developing
        personality theory, Murray was recruited to the OSS at the start of the
        war, applying his theories to the selection of agents and also
        presumably to interrogation.
        <p>As chairman of the Department of Social Relations at Harvard, Murray
        zealously prosecuted the CIA's efforts to carry forward experiments in
        mind control conducted by Nazi doctors in the concentration camps. The
        overall program was under the control of the late Sidney Gottlieb, head
        of the CIA's technical services division. Just as Harvard students were
        fed doses of LSD, psilocybin and other potions, so too were prisoners
        and many unwitting guinea pigs.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        </font>
      <td vAlign="top" width="50%"><font size="2">Sometimes the results were
        disastrous. A dram of LSD fed by Gottlieb himself to an unwitting U.S.
        army officer, Frank Olson, plunged Olson into escalating psychotic
        episodes, which culminated in Olson's fatal descent from an upper window
        in the Statler-Hilton in New York. Gottlieb was the object of a lawsuit
        not only by Olson's children but also by the sister of another man,
        Stanley Milton Glickman, whose life had disintegrated into psychosis
        after being unwittingly given a dose of LSD by Gottlieb.
        <p>What did Murray give Kaczynski? Did the experiment's long-term
        effects help tilt him into the Unabomber's homicidal rampages? The CIA's
        mind experiment program was vast. How many other human time bombs were
        thus primed? How many of them have exploded?
        <p>There are other human time bombs, primed in haste, ignorance or
        indifference to long-term consequences. Amid all the finger-pointing to
        causes prompting the recent wave of schoolyard killings, not nearly
        enough clamor has been raised about the fact that many of these
        teenagers suddenly exploding into mania were on a regimen of
        antidepressants. Eric Harris, one of the shooters at Columbine, was on
        Luvox. Kip Kinkel, who killed his parents and two students in Oregon,
        was on Prozac.
        <p>There are a number of other instances. Apropos possible linkage, Dr.
        Peter Breggin, author of books on Prozac and Ritalin, has said, &quot;I
        have no doubt that Prozac can contribute to violence and suicide. I've
        seen many cases. In the recent clinical trial, 6% of the children became
        psychotic on Prozac. And manic psychosis can lead to violence.&quot;
        <p>A 15-year-old girl attending a ritzy liberal arts school in the
        Northeast told me that 80% of the kids in her class were on Prozac,
        Ritalin or Dexedrine. The pretext used by the school authorities is
        attention deficit disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
        or ADHD, with a diagnosis made on the basis of questions such as:
        &quot;Do you find yourself daydreaming or looking out the window?&quot;
        <p>Ritalin is being given to about 2 million American schoolchildren. A
        1986 article by Richard Scarnati in the International Journal of the
        Addictions lists more than a hundred adverse reactions to Ritalin,
        including paranoid delusions, paranoid psychosis, amphetamine-like
        psychosis and terror. Meanwhile, uncertainty reigns on the precise
        nature of the complaint that Ritalin is supposed to be treating. One
        panel reviewing the proceedings at a conference on ADHD last year even
        doubted whether the disorder is a &quot;valid&quot; diagnosis of a broad
        range of children's behavior, and said there was little evidence Ritalin
        did any good. In 1996, the Drug Enforcement Administration denounced the
        use of Ritalin and concluded that &quot;the dramatic increase in the use
        of Ritalin in the 1990s should be viewed as a marker or warning to
        society.&quot;
        <p>Indeed. Land mines now litter the terrain of our society, waiting to
        explode.</p>
