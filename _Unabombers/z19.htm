<H1 align="center">Louis Freeh and the VanPac Case... Murder at the highest level !</H1>
<p class="intro" align="center">On the day Judge Robert Vance was murdered Louis 
Freeh was an unknown prosecutor in the state of New York. Three years later 
Louis Freeh was director of the FBI. </p>
<p class="intro" align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="intro" align="center">Although Vance's caseload was 60% drug 
related,&nbsp; the FBI, the agency that never communicates with the CIA,&nbsp; immediately responded 
&quot;drugs were no more prominent than several other avenues we are following&quot;.&nbsp; 
But Vance had been preparing to hear a series of cases, all pointing to 
the CIA as a major source of Cocaine... and Vance had a reputation for absolute 
and dogmatic honesty. The FBI soon &quot;discovered&quot; <b>from the records of Vance's 
prior trials</b> that the bombs were <b>EXACT</b> duplicates of bombs Walter 
Leroy Moody had sent years earlier. Supposedly, Moody had painted both cardboard 
box bombs interiors with black paint, used the exact same welded end caps etc 
etc... Supposedly Moody must have been rather stupid and not known the bombs 
would point directly to him like a Neon sign. But patsy-to-be Moody did not know how to 
weld. Ted Banks was accused of doing the welding.... a deal was struck to pin it 
all on Moody. A conviction was secured and the case drifted into history. </p>
<p class="intro" align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="intro" align="center"><b>Then it all unraveled. </b> </p>
<p class="intro" align="center">In Federal Appeals court counterfeiter turned patriot Ted Banks 
<a href="http://www.unabombers.com/VanPac/v95-03-29-False%20Testimony-1.htm">blew the whistle</a> on then Assistant U.S. Atty. Louis Freeh. Patriot Banks accepted a ten 
year addition to his sentence as the price of telling the truth. He pointed at 
Freeh from the stand and said &quot;I lied and he told me to Lie, I never welded no bombs for 
Moody&quot;. Then FBI agent Whitehurst charged the FBI had fabricated evidence, 
... then the 
Vance bomb was identified in the Unabom case as originating from Saratoga 
California.... then the world court threw out the Lockerby conviction cause FBI 
agent J Thomas Thurman could not be trusted...because he was not credible in 
their eyes after his role in the Vance debacle... and the US press is still silent.</p>

<p class="intro" align="center">&nbsp;This site, Unabombers.com,&nbsp; provides insights into 
the activities of the FBI/CIA pre September 11th 2001. Activities that 
include the <b>manufacture</b> and <b>management</b> of a series of high

and multiple witnesses.<br>

<p class="keys" align="center">Hopefully some day they will erect a statue to 
Ted Banks just like the one they erected to Nathan Hale at Yale...the same pose 
would be appropriate since they both did essentially the same thing. I would 
like to suggest an inscription for that day and that statue ...</p>
