<p class="intro" align="Center">Unabombers.com is an ongoing independent research project into the Unabomber
Case. The Mass Media has been ignoring the real facts of the case and printing
government propaganda. You already knew that Kaczynski fertilized his vegetables
with his own feces, but somehow they forgot to point out that he made a Bank
Deposit 25 hours away from a bombing and did it two hours after the bomb was
placed in Sacramento. Everyone knows he was a misfit at Harvard University, but few know
that he participated in a CIA Mind Control project while he was there. If you have spent 
any time with this site you already realize
that it represents a major challenge to the official versions of events. The existence
of such a contorted official version of events is a dangerous warning to all who
value democracy, good government, and a stable society. When the mass media is
reduced to a corporate stooge, independent based investigations published
through the internet are the only slim hope left for an informed citizenry. It
didn't take a genius to look at the sketches, listen to the witness statements,
and conclude that they sat there and drew their patsy no matter what the witness
said. What it did take was independence of action and thought. The implications of 
all this should alarm you. They certainly alarm me.&nbsp;</p>

Donation proceeds pay for Freedom of Information suits,
Private investigators, Polygraphers and Newspaper Ads. The official version of 
events is supported with unlimited Government funds, the truth, if it is 
supported at all, is supported by only you. Donations are
accepted in any amount and the proceeds ALL go to further this investigation into
the truth and the <u>free</u> public dissemination of that information. It is an 
investment in the truth. Donations can be sent via PayPal</p>
