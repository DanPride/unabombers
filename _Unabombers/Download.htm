The Download is approximately 100 MB</p>
<p class="para" align="left">
The Download is in zip format and will expand to set of folders and files which 
comprise the site.</p>
<p class="para" align="left">
To burn a CD from the Download, expand the zip file then burn all the files and folders inside 
to the root level of the CD. This will place the auto run file at the root 
level of the CD. When you open the CD you should see a list of folders and files 
(including the index.html and autorun)</p>
<p class="para" align="left">The CD should then auto launch to the Main Page of Unabombers.com whenever it 
is inserted into a CD drive. All paths have been localized so the site will run 
normally from the CD without an internet connection or the possibility of being 
observed exercising your rights of free speech and information. 
All non-local paths are included in their original state and will connect to the site if the machine is connected to the internet, 
or produce a page not found message if the machine is not connected to the 
internet. Clicking on the index.html file will also launch you into the site if 
you are having trouble with the auto run.</p>
<p class="para" align="left">The download may also be used as a duplicate site 
hosted on any LAN or WAN, under any domain name desired, by anyone... as long as 
the content is not altered in any substantive way. </p>
<p class="para" align="left">The site is written in strict html 4.0 and can be 
hosted on a Mac, Windows or Unix box.</p>
