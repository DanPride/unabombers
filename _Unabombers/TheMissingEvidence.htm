<P>FBI agents at the Calverton hangar where wreckage from TWA Flight 800 was 
being examined to determine the cause of the crash removed a piece from the 
leading edge of one wing, two sources told The Village Voice. These sources said 
the wing piece bore possible evidence of the explosion of a missile warhead.</P>
<P>Journalist and author James Sanders alleges that two unnamed National 
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators told him that the FBI would not 
allow the piece to be tagged and put into the NTSB computer; instead they had it 
flown to Washington, D.C. However, although the wing piece apparently hasn't 
been entered into its database, NTSB managing director Peter Goelz denies that 
the FBI prevented his agency from logging any information. The wing piece, which 
seems to have vanished, tested positive for explosives in an examination in 
Calverton, according to Sanders, and had a series of punctures in the apex of 
the leading edge that could have been made by shrapnel traveling at high 
velocity.</P>
<P>An Air National Guard helicopter pilot named Fred Meyer said the piece of 
debris, "about five feet long," was likely the one he ferried from Calverton to 
his base at Westhampton Beach in July or early August 1996. "I knew from looking 
at it that it was the leading edge of some aerofoil--horizontal stabilizer, 
rudder, or wing--and it had punctures in it. We're talking about a piece of 
aluminum alloy that is very strong and rigid. In this were dimples with holes in 
the center of the dimple, like something was driven through with incredible 
force--I would say four to six holes," Meyer told the Voice.</P>
<P>FBI spokesman Joe Valiquette says the agency did indeed remove a wing piece 
with a series of holes in it and flew it to an FBI lab in Washington. There it 
was determined, he says, that the holes were not caused by an explosion, nor was 
any suspicious residue found on the wing. Sanders, however, insists that his 
sources, both NTSB investigators, told him residue was discovered on the wing 
piece, and it had tested positive for explosives. Although The New York Times 
quoted an unnamed source as saying that a preliminary test on the wing piece 
came back "borderline positive" for explosive material, NTSB director Goelz says 
the Times report was incorrect and denies that there was any positive test for 
explosives.</P>
<P>Valiquette says the FBI returned the wing with the suspicious holes in it to 
the NTSB investigation in Calverton, along with a lab report showing the 
negative results of a test for explosives. However, NTSB director Goelz says he 
is not aware of any piece from a wing edge with holes in it. "Do you have a 
reference number?" he asked. As the Voice was going to press, more than a week 
after first requesting specific comment, Goelz said he was still trying to 
locate the wing piece.</P> 
<a name="Stamps"></a>
<P>In other words, the wing piece has not been reexamined by the NTSB. This is 
alarming given the intense criticism that arose last year over the integrity of 
FBI crime labs. <a href="http://www.unabombers.com/#Stamps2"><font color=Blue>
Last fall before a Senate committee, Inspector General Michael 
Bromwich stated that "hundreds if not thousands of cases are implicated" in the 
mishandling of evidence in FBI labs. 
The former FBI crime lab unit chief James 
Corby also testified that explosives unit chief J. Thomas Thurman, who was 
involved in the TWA Flight 800 investigation, was a particular problem. "Special 
agent Thurman did alter reports intentionally," Corby said. Further tests of the 
wing piece by the NTSB would have been reassuring.</a></font></P>
<P>But the uncertainty cannot be resolved. The wing piece is missing.</P>
<P>Both the FBI and NTSB, nevertheless, have ruled out a missile as the cause of 
the crash, a conclusion much disputed by Sanders, Meyer, and other critics of 
the investigation. Bound for Paris, the 747 exploded without warning at 8:31 
p.m., July 17, 1996, about 12 minutes after takeoff from Kennedy airport. The 
plane was eight miles south of Long Island at about 13, 700 feet on a hazy 
evening, just after sunset. All 230 passengers and crew were killed.</P>
<P>What became the most expensive investigation ever into a civilian air 
disaster ($28 million and counting) was launched, with the FBI and the NTSB 
sharing the load. The FBI searched for evidence of a crime, while the NTSB 
assumed its mandate to investigate major air crashes. Although neither agency 
has determined the cause of the explosion, last week the NTSB recommended the 
rewiring of thousands of airliners, mostly 747s, built by Boeing and other 
companies, which may reduce the risk of sparks that could ignite fuel 
vapors.</P>
<P>The FBI-NTSB joint investigation was not a comfortable fit. Indeed, tensions 
between the agencies reportedly arose immediately over the interviewing of 
eyewitnesses and the handling of evidence. The FBI's most pressing concern at 
Calverton, Sanders insists, was to be on the lookout for certain kinds of 
evidence. A retired police officer from Seal Beach, California, Sanders is the 
author of The Downing of TWA Flight 800 (Zebra Books, 1997), which argues that 
the 747 was shot down by a U.S. Navy missile during an exercise. "The FBI was 
coming in when there appeared to be sensitive pieces coming onto the floor of 
the hangar," Sanders told the Voice, "but before they'd been tagged and 
catalogued and put into the NTSB computer they would be removed, never to be 
seen again."</P>
<P>Sanders's source for this is Terrell Stacey, a veteran TWA captain who on 
July 16 had flown from Paris to New York the very aircraft that the following 
day would be designated TWA 800. Stacey was chosen to represent the company in 
the investigation "because of his expertise in dealing with the 747," said TWA 
spokesman Mark Abels.</P>
<P>When Sanders first spoke to Stacey, he remembers, Stacey said, "If you'd 
called a week ago I'd have blown you off, but things are so bad inside the 
hangar that, yeah, I'll talk to you."</P>
<P>Sanders says that Stacey told him he had watched the FBI walk off with a 
structural piece called a "pickle fork," for example. "This particular one was 
on the right side, where the wing meets the fuselage. This pickle fork had 
exterior strike marks: something outside going into the plane had hit it The FBI 
took it," says Sanders. The NTSB's Peter Goelz says he was notready to comment 
on the pickle fork. The FBI also had no comment.</P>
<P>At secret meetings in hotel rooms, Stacey told Sanders he was not the only 
one dismayed at the spectacle of disappearing debris. There were times, Sanders 
says Stacey told him, when senior NTSB management had to deal with a virtual 
rebellion from workers who felt that the investigation was being derailed by the 
FBI. By January 1997, Sanders says, "he was saying that on the NTSB side 
virtually all the workers on the floor had come to the conclusion it must have 
been a missile." (When this reporter visited Stacey's home in rural New Jersey, 
he declined to comment, citing the legal troubles that have arisen as a result 
of his role as a primary source in Sanders's book.)</P>
<P>In addition to his tales from the hangar, Stacey brought a printout of an 
NTSB log to one of the meetings with Sanders. The printout, a copy of which was 
obtained by The Village Voice, lists hundreds of pieces of debris, noting where 
each was found on the ocean floor. During the early days of the recovery effort 
the order in which pieces blew off the aircraft was apparently considered 
important. "Things that fall off first tend to be clues to what happened," an 
unidentified investigator told The New York Times.</P>
<P>With that principle in mind, Sanders notes, "CW504 is particularly 
fascinating because it was the first structural piece to fall off." This piece 
is part of the front spar, which is the front wall of the center fuel tank in 
the belly of the aircraft between the two wings. No fuel or fuel vapor comes 
into contact with the front spar because it is separated from the rest of the 
tank by a dry bay.</P>
<P>In his summary of the NTSB's account of how the airplane came apart, a 
process that for the NTSB began with an explosion of vapor in the center fuel 
tank, senior metallurgist James Wildey writes, "In some cases, the Group had to 
accept that some features either could not be explained by the proposed scenario 
or might even be in conflict with the proposed scenario. A case in point of an 
apparent conflict is the recovery location of front spar piece CW504 in the 
earliest part of the red area [the area nearest to Kennedy airport]."</P>
<P>The problem with CW504 is that although several more bits of the front spar 
were found in the red zone, most of the center fuel tank was recovered from the 
green zone, the debris field a couple of miles to the north and east where the 
aft fuselage section fell. Possibly on account of this, one mid- August 1996 
article in The New York Times reported that investigators had concluded that the 
center fuel tank exploded as much as 24 seconds after the initial blast.</P>
<P>Sanders pointed out that another NTSB report, "The Trajectory Study," 
grappled with the enigma of CW504 and the piece RF35, which also fell off in the 
first few seconds after the initial event and landed early in the red zone. RF35 
was a piece of the right fuselage above the front of the wing, containing some 
cabin windows. On NTSB photos of the fuselage reconstruction it is just above a 
gaping hole, and just in front of the tear in the fuselage where the first-class 
section and nose sheared away from the rest of the aircraft.</P>
<P>"The Trajectory Study" states that, using accepted principles to calculate 
the trajectory of these two pieces, both would have had to leave the aircraft 
before the last transponder radar return, which is presumed to be impossible. 
After pages of calculations the report concludes that CW504 must have spun like 
a Frisbee, and that RF35 probably glided, to reach their respective recovery 
positions.</P>
<P>But to Sanders, no fancy aeronautical theorizing is needed to explain all 
this. You just have to suppose that in fact the center fuel tank, if it did 
explode, had nothing to do with the ejection of these pieces from the aircraft. 
What did cause them to break away so suddenly was a missile that hit the plane 
just forward of the wings, leaving the residue on the wing leading edge and the 
strike marks on the pickle fork, and knocking out RF35 and CW504. Then there was 
the trail of reddish orange residue on seats in rows 17 to 19.</P>
<P>This residue was on two pieces of seat fabric that Stacey took from the 
hangar. Sanders had it analyzed at a laboratory. He now says he regrets not 
asking the lab simply to test for explosives, instead of giving him a breakdown 
of all the metals and chemical compounds in the residue. But a breakdown is what 
he got, and he says that missile manufacturers like Thiokol acknowledge that the 
chemical brew is found in missiles and the fuel that drives them. The FBI 
insists the residue is nothing but glue, used to refurbish the seats in that 
particular section of the plane.</P>
<P>Whatever the residue is, it has gotten Sanders, Stacey, and Sanders's wife, 
Liz, into serious legal trouble. After Sanders's missile theory was published in 
The Press-Enterprise newspaper in Riverside, California, and a month later in 
The Downing of TWA Flight 800, the FBI subpoenaed Sanders's phone records.</P>
<P>In doing so, Sanders says, they ignored his rights as a journalist. Assistant 
U.S. Attorney Ben Campbell insisted that the conditions were met for a subpoena 
to be issued for the phone records of a member of the media. Sanders says the 
FBI moved so quickly that he had no chance to challenge the subpoena, signed by 
Attorney General Janet Reno.</P>
<P>After the FBI found Stacey's name in the phone records, they questioned him 
and he agreed to cooperate in return for a reduced charge of misdemeanor theft. 
This was in June 1997. Strangely, the FBI permitted Stacey to remain part of the 
investigation, with access to the Calverton hangar, until they were ready to 
charge him, which didn't happen until December.</P>
<P>Stacey's guilty plea carries the risk of a one-year jail sentence and a fine 
of up to $100,000. He is scheduled to be sentenced in June. Sanders and his 
wife, Liz, an ex--TWA employee whose only role, she says, was to ask Stacey if 
he would speak to her husband, face up to 10 years in jail if they are convicted 
of charges of conspiracy to steal and theft of material from an aircraft 
accident. Their trial has yet to be scheduled.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Sanders says that, partly as a result of learning about the holes 
in the wing debris, he has changed his mind to some degree about the accident. 
In his book he theorized that an unarmed missile had hit the plane Now, he says, 
"I no longer think the warhead was inert."</P>
<P align=center><B>Ships Ahoy!</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>It's one of the enduring mysteries of Flight 800: Just how much unexplained 
activity was there out on the ocean, before and after the moment on Wednesday 
evening, July 17, 1996, when TWA 800 exploded?</P>
<P>The Voice reported (March 3) the story of Dean Seward, a young airline pilot 
, ex--U.S. Navy, who spent that afternoon sunbathing with his girlfriend at 
Gilgo State Park. Around midafternoon he saw a naval warship about three miles 
offshore. Seward thought nothing of it at the time, but when Pierre Salinger 
came out with his allegation that TWA 800 had been shot down by a U S. Navy 
missile, Seward wondered if the ship he saw might have played a role in the 
mystery.</P>
<P>He faxed an account of what he had seen to the Air Line Pilots' Association, 
which is one of the parties to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) 
investigation into Flight 800, and ALPA sent the fax to the FBI. The NTSB and 
FBI refused comment on Seward's sighting, and the navy, although it has admitted 
that three of its submarines were within 150 miles from the crash site, 
reiterated that none of its warships was in the vicinity.</P>
<P>However, evidence that seems to support Seward's story lies in the NTSB's own 
"Airplane Performance Group Factual Report." On page 5 are listed four 
unidentified radar tracks, "consistent with the speed of a boat," which were 
recorded on FAA radar at the moment TWA 800 exploded. The closest of these to 
the crash site is stated to be "less than 3 nautical miles south- southeast 
moving south-southwest at just over 30 knots groundspeed." On a graph on page 43 
of the report, the 30-knot track, clearly shown, continues to move away from the 
crash site over a period of 20 minutes, from 8:30 to 8 :50 p.m.</P>
<P>Military experts and deep-sea fishermen we spoke to agreed that it's rare for 
a vessel to travel at 30 knots. Naval destroyers and cruisers capable of 30 
knots or more rarely travel at that speed because it is so expensive. Commercial 
shipping goes much slower as a rule. Thirty knots may be in the range of some 
small speedboats and private yachts, but then consider that this was quite a way 
out in the Atlantic. According to one deep-sea fisherman who regularly fishes 
the area where Flight 800 came down, "There are no high-speed powerboats running 
10 miles offshore--they just don't go out there."</P>
<P>Neither the navy nor the Coast Guard has made any comment on the 30-knot 
track, or any of the other unidentified tracks, which were moving more slowly, 
all within six nautical miles of the crash site. Peter Goelz, managing director 
of the NTSB, says, "It was the FBI's responsibility toidentify those vessels. To 
my understanding, they have not identified whoowned the [30-knot track] vessel. 
We assume it was a pleasure craft of some size." The FBI's James Kallstrom said 
last November that the FBI made an exhaustive investigation of 371 vessels in 
the waters off Long Island that day. FBI spokesman Joe Valiquette had no comment 
on the unidentified tracks.--R.D.</P>
