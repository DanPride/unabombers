</p><p class="body" align="Left">The nationwide search for the suspected serial bomber who has killed two people and wounded 23 others spread into cyberspace Tuesday.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI, investigating whether a hatred of computers may be behind the mail-bomber's campaign of terror, has asked for help from Internet computer networkers. The bomber has been named 
&quot;<strong>UNABOM&quot;</strong> for his propensity to target universities and airline officials for the past 16 years.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Officials have speculated that the bomber might have lost his job to a computer, leading him to pick victims with ties to high technology.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The hunt for the bomber, who uses precisely constructed and powerful homemade devices, was made all the more pressing by fears he may soon strike again, a high-ranking FBI agent in Newark, N.J., said Tuesday.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;We are still nervous about another bomb being out there somewhere,&quot; the agent said. 
&quot;It's very possible.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI agent noted that the bomber's last two attacks, in 1993, came within days of each other.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Thomas Mosser, a 50-year-old advertising executive, was killed in his New Jersey home by a package bomb Saturday that the FBI said fit a pattern of terror by mail dating to 1978, including attacks 
in the Chicago area.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI has posted its offer of a $ 1 million reward over the Internet for the capture and conviction of the bomber. It also has set up a hotline with an 800 number, 800-701-BOMB. &quot;Dear Netters, the purpose for submitting the information on the Internet is twofold,&quot; the FBI said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;First, the Internet is another medium that enables us to reach as wide an audience as possible, to spread the word. Second, Internet users are precisely the type of individuals that . . . have been recipients of explosive devices attributed to 
<strong>UNABOM;</strong> scholars and researchers.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The hunt for the killer was focusing on the San Francisco area,&nbsp; where the the videotape-size package holding the bomb was mailed Dec. 3, the FBI said Monday.
