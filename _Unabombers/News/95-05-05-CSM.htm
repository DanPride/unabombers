</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> By Daniel Schorr; Daniel Schorr is senior news analyst for National Public 
Radio.  



<strong>HIGHLIGHT:</strong>
Media decisionmakers are stuck between what might happen if they don't do what 
terrorists ask and encouraging blackmail if they do 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">OKLAHOMA CITY was terrorism wholesale. The 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> practiced terrorism retail. The one was supposedly in protest against a world 
government conspiracy, the other against a world technological conspiracy. Both 
seemed bent on breaking down government and society.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In common they have paranoia and a dehumanization that can come with paranoia. 
Timothy McVeigh, calling himself a prisoner of war, showed no emotion about 
shattered lives in Oklahoma City. The 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> in his letter to the New York Times, displayed no remorse about his actions. A 
reformed German former neo-Nazi, Ingo Hasselbach, says that ideology and 
conspiratorial thinking can destroy ''even the most basic human sympathy.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">This is far from what Sen. Barry Goldwater had in mind when he said in 1964, 
''Extremism in defense of liberty is no vice.'' But running through the 
bloodstream of American history there are paranoid strains and violent strains 
that can, in combination, be devastating. The ''conspiracies'' run from the 
Papist plots of the 19th century to the Communist plots of the McCarthy days. 
Violence runs from John Brown and the abolitionists to the Ku Klux Klan, all 
investing themselves with moral rectitude.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Whether inflammatory talk over the airwaves contributes to inciting those 
predisposed to violence needs more dispassionate study than the current 
emotional climate seems to permit. But more important than external influences 
may be the pathology of alienation. It seems clear that those bent on slaying 
some demon called ''government'' are affected by rootlessness and frustration, 
often fostered by economic dislocation and insecurity.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Ego satisfaction
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Several 
analyses, including one in the Wall Street Journal, have raised the question of 
whether we are witnessing some extreme form of white male rage. That may be too 
facile an idea. Yet it is true that we see mainly white male faces in the 
militia camps. And the FBI believes the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> is a white male, as well.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> presented the New York Times with a painful decision when he offered to call 
off attacks on persons, although not on property, in return for publication of 
his manuscript, running some 30,000 words. If his offer is not accepted, he 
said, ''We will start building our next bomb.'' Publisher Arthur Sulzberger 
said his paper ''can't be held hostage by those who threaten violence,'' but 
the Times would look at the manuscript and make a ''journalistic decision'' 
about publishing it.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The phenomenon of blackmailing the 
news media has grown with the growing importance of the media as a way for 
terrorists to achieve ego satisfaction. Often news managers submit rather than 
face the consequences of refusal. In 1975, the German Bader-Meinhof gang 
negotiated the release of five of its jailed members in return for releasing a 
kidnapped politician. As part of the deal, German television showed the gang 
members boarding a plane and broadcast dictated propaganda statements. A German 
TV executive later said ''We lost control of our medium.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A year later, Croatian nationalists in this country hijacked a Chicago-bound 
plane and threatened to kill its 92 passengers unless its propaganda statement 
was published in American newspapers. The New York Times, the Chicago Tribune, 
the Washington Post, and the Los Angeles Times were induced by the American 
authorities to comply. The 
passengers were released. The hijackers eventually flew to Paris where they 
surrendered in response to an ultimatum from French authorities. Benjamin 
Bradlee, the retired executive editor of the Post says that today he would 
probably not have yielded to that threat, but back then, he could not face the 
possibility of a story that would say, ''Umpteen American hostages were killed 
today because Bradlee refused to publish.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> A year after that, in 1977, the New York serial killer who called himself 
''Son of Sam'' demanded that Jimmy Breslin, then a New York Daily News 
columnist, publish his letters. After talking to the police, Breslin did so. 
When finally captured, the killer, David Berkowitz, said in a prison interview 
that seeing his letters in Breslin's column gave him ''a rush.'' Robert 
Ressler, an FBI veteran, believes that seeing his prose in print probably 
escalated Berkowitz's murderous activities.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Agonizing choices
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> That points to the dilemma the The New York Times faces. Giving terrorists the 
media kicks they demand may or may not deter them from further violence. In any 
event, if the blackmail succeeds it invites others to try threats of violence 
as a way to validate their importance. The Times, which has been consulting the 
FBI, is walking on eggshells. ''We can't be held hostage,'' says Sulzberger, 
''but we'll look at the manuscript, make a journalistic decision, and whether 
we publish it ourselves or not, we'll do all we responsibly can to make it 
public.'' That is clearly intended to gain time, to keep the serial bomber 
negotiating.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> But at the end, there will be a decision to make and it will be agonizing. To 
surrender to blackmail is to invite more blackmail. But then, every editor has 
in mind Ben Bradlee's fear of 
blame for ''umpteen Americans killed.''
