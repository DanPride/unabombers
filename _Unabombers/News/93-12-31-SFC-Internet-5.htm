 FBI circulates a plea for tips on electronic bulletin 



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> Bill Wallace, Chronicle Staff Writer 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The heading of the December 23 Internet message was an eye- catcher, even for 
the advanced computer users who regularly scan the ''World Wide Web'' bulletin 
board:
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''Subject: Information from the FBI 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> Task Force. . . .''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The message that followed was essentially a cyberspace press release from the 
bureau containing information about the 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> case, a federal investigation into a bizarre series of mail bombings during 
the past 15 years that has killed one person and injured 23 others.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The message marks the emergence of a brand new information- gathering tool for 
federal investigators -- the ''information superhighway'' that links millions 
of computer users around the world. The 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> case is believed to be the first probe in which federal agents have used the 
Internet as a crime-stopper's aid.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''One of the things I was interested in when we first did this was whether or 
not Internet had been 
used in this way before,'' said FBI Inspector George Clow, a supervising 
investigator in the case. ''To the best of our knowledge, it has not. There may 
have been some limited efforts to use the system in other cases, but nothing on 
a sustained national basis like this.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Internet is a former military communications web that now serves more than 
20 million users around the word. Initially, the network primarily served 
academics, but more recently it has become a general-purpose communications 
system available to many home and business computer users through such 
commercial computer services as CompuServe and America Online.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI said the Internet is primarily being used to disseminate press release 
information about the 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> bombings. The December 23 notice, for example, recapped information that had 
already been released to newspapers and television and radio outlets.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The message, from FBI agent Bill Tafoya, tells Internet users: ''You are not 
being asked to place yourself in harm's way,'' but it asks them ''to come 
forward if you have information that might help identify, arrest and convict 
the person(s) responsible for these bombings.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">It gives a toll-free telephone number for the task force -- (800) 701-2662 -- 
and includes the address for the task force's Internet electronic mailbox.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">WHY NETWORK WAS USED
</p><p class="body" align="Left">According to the text of the December 23 Internet message, the FBI sent its 
inquiry onto the computer network for two reasons: 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''First, the Internet is another medium that enables us to reach as wide an 
audience as possible -- to 'spread the word.' Second, Internet users are 
precisely the type of individuals that, to date, have been recipients of 
explosive devices attributed to 
<strong>UNABOM:</strong> scholars and researchers.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In addition to posting notifications about the case, the Internet system has 
been used to disseminate information about the handling of materials that may 
be bombs.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''Basically, it (Internet) is just another media form that has been used to 
make this information available to as many people as possible,'' said Alec 
Deacon, a NASA employee 
who set up the 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> electronic mailbox on a space agency computer at Moffett Field in Mountain 
View.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''The information has been on the TV and the radio, and it has been in the 
papers. Now it is on 'the net,' too.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">COMPUTER-LITERATE TARGETS
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Law enforcement sources say the 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> investigation is the perfect place to experiment with the technique because 
the bombing targets have consisted largely of such organizations as 
universities and computer companies where a lot of people are computer-literate.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The most recent blast injured a Yale University professor when he attempted to 
open a package June 26. A day earlier, a similar explosion injured a University 
of California at San Francisco genetics professor.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Other educational institutions that have been the targets of bombings linked to 
the 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> case include the University of California at Berkeley, Northwestern University 
in Evanston, 
Ill., the University of Utah and the University of Michigan.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">PHONE CONTACT PREFERRED
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Although FBI messages posted on the network include the electronic mailbox 
code, Deacon said the bureau ''would prefer to have people with information 
about the case go through the 800-line rather than using Internet itself.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI has offered a $ 1 million reward for information leading to conviction 
of whoever sent the bombs.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''We really feel there is somebody out there who knows this guy and who will 
realize it if they give it a little thought,'' said Clow. ''It could be 
somebody who just happens to have run across him. It could be somebody who has 
actually participated in the crimes.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''We're not concerned about whether we get a large volume of calls,'' he said. 
''We just want to get the right call.''
