</p><p class="body" align="Left">La Jolla When the bulky package arrived in the mail, the woman immediately 
thought it could be another of the mail bombs that this week injured two 
university professors on opposite coasts. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The woman said that she received the package Thursday at her home on Avenida 
Mirola near Nautilus Street and that it was addressed to a UCSD professor whose 
name she did not recognize, police said.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Bombings this week injured a professor at Yale University and another at the 
University of California San Francisco.  The blasts appear to be related to 
other terrorist bombings of people who worked in the high-tech field during the 
1970s and 1980s. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Fearing the worst, the woman, who was not identified, called the police bomb 
squad.  The explosives experts carefully took the suspicious package to the 
Torrey Pines Glider Port, where they doused it with a water cannon, police 
said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Then, a careful look showed that it was not a bomb at all. a rather extensive 
term paper written by an unfortunate student who apparently put the wrong 
street address on the package, police said.
