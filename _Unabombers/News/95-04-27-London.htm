A SERIAL bomber has described his motives in greater detail than before after 
his 16th attack in 17 years killed an executive in California on Monday. The 
FBI said the man, known as 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> sent three letters when posting the device that killed Gilbert Murray, the 
president of the pro-logging California Forestry Association, in Sacramento. 
Two letters went to survivors of previous bombs. In the third, to the New York 
Times, he repeated claims to be a member of an anarchist group and defined his 
targets as leaders in technological fields considered destructive to the 
environment. Targets have been university professors, scientists and people 
engaged in environmentally sensitive work. The FBI called him 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> because his first targets were university executives and airlines. 
&quot;We have nothing against universities or scholars as such. All the university 
people we have attacked have been specialists in technical fields. (We 
consider certain areas of applied psychology, such as behaviour modification, 
to be technical fields),&quot; he wrote. 
&quot;We would not want anyone to think we have any desire to hurt professors who 
study archaeology, history, literature or harmless stuff like that. The people 
we are out to get are the scientists and engineers, especially in computers and 
genetics.&quot; Monday's device, wrapped immaculately in a parcel the size of a shoebox, bore 
the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> hallmarks of components fashioned by hand from wood and metal. The FBI says 
his bombs usually contain wooden components which would take hours to carve.  
His targets and the return addresses he puts on the parcels often include the 
words 
&quot;wood&quot;, or 
&quot;forest&quot;. In the letter, he complained: 
&quot;We are getting tired of making bombs.&quot; Special Agent Jim Freeman, the head of the FBI's San Francisco unit, who is 
leading the hunt, said: 
&quot;This guy has flipped out. He is describing his actions and motives for the 
first time.&quot; In the last attack, in December 1994, a mail bomb killed Thomas Mosser, an 
advertising executive, at his New Jersey home. The first, on May 25, 1978, 
injured a security guard at Northwestern University, Illinois. The letter 
indicated 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> was confident he would not be caught: 
&quot;We are in a position to do a great deal of damage. And it doesn't appear that 
the FBI is going to catch us anytime soon. The FBI is a joke.&quot;
