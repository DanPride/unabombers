N.J. Death Linked to Case That Started Here in 1978 



<strong>SOURCE:</strong> ASSOCIATED PRESS 



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> By Roberto Suro 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The killing of a New Jersey advertising executive apparently was the latest in 
a 16-year series of attacks by a bomber who specializes in mailing lethal 
packages, the FBI said Sunday.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bomber, code-named 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> by federal authorities, has been held responsible for 14 previous incidents 
that have resulted in 23 injuries and one other death. The code name reflects 
the fact that most of the bomber's early targets involved universities or 
airlines.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The attacks began in 1978, when a security guard at the University of Illinois 
at Chicago opened a suspicious package and it exploded. Two months later, there 
was a bombing at Northwestern University in Evanston, and 18 months later, a 
bomb went off on a Chicago-to-Washington jetliner.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">On Saturday morning, Thomas J. Mosser, 50, died at his home in North Caldwell, 
N.J., after opening a package delivered by the Postal Service. A statement 
issued by the FBI's Newark field office Sunday said the bomb that killed Mosser 
&quot;appears to have been constructed and mailed by 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">the same individual&quot; involved in the other 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> cases.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;A physical examination of the bomb's components have led us to believe that 
this is linked to the other cases because there are some unique characteristics,&quot; said FBI Special Agent Rick Smith.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Investigators are also trying to determine where the bomb was mailed from and 
whether Mosser had any connection to either the airline industry or scientific 
research, especially in the area of computers. Most of the bomber's previous 
victims have worked in those fields, Smith said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bomb that killed Mosser was about the size of a videotape. Experts have 
described previous bombs as 
&quot;diabolical&quot; in construction because they involved hundreds of hours of meticulous work, 
including the creation of handcrafted parts.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI statement said the bomber is believed to be a white man in his late 30s 
to 40s 
&quot;with a high school education who has an exposure to and; or familiarity with 
the college environment.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The only known sighting of the bomber came in 1987, when a man was seen behind 
a computer store placing a package that later exploded, injuring one person. 
The man was described as white with a ruddy complexion and blond or red hair. 
The FBI Sunday issued a sketch based on this sighting.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mosser recently was named executive vice president and general manager of Young 
&amp; Rubicam Inc. Worldwide, one of the largest ad agencies in the world. He does 
not seem to fit the pattern of the bomber's other 
victims, most of whom have worked at universities or been involved in research. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The package to Mosser arrived Friday, but sat unopened in a pile of mail as the 
Mossers spent the evening hosting a party for one of their daughters. It 
exploded Saturday as Mosser was opening it in his kitchen. Family members 
elsewhere in the house were not hurt.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The other death among the 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> cases was that of Hugh C. Scrutton, a Sacramento, Calif., businessman, who was 
killed on Dec. 11, 1985, when he picked up a bomb disguised as a block of wood 
near the rear entrance of his computer rental store.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bomber has sometimes appeared to take some care in selecting and preparing 
his targets. For example, Percy Wood, a former president of United Airlines, 
received a letter in his Lake Forest, 
Ill., home in June, 1980, telling him to expect a book he needed to read about 
a week before he received a book-sized package containing a bomb.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In other cases, the bomber has been less discriminating. On Nov. 15, 1979, a 
bomb exploded on American Airlines Flight 444 as it flew from Chicago to 
Washington. The device was designed to explode at high altitude and caused 12 
injuries.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> Task Force is offering a reward of up to $ 1 million for information leading 
to arrest and conviction in the case. The task force can be reached at (800) 
701-2662.
