</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Authorities charged a 42-year-old part-time Northeastern University student 
yesterday with making anti-Semitic bomb threats targeting Northeastern and 
Harvard universities and the president of a Belmont bank.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Stephen Womack was arraigned in Cambridge District Court on charges of 
receiving stolen property and malicious destruction of hundreds of books from 
the college libraries, in addition to the six counts of extortion by threat of 
physical harm.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">As the bushy-haired Womack calmly chatted with a court officer, a plea of not 
guilty was entered for him. He was held without bail until a hearing on 
Tuesday.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The former clerk at Harvard's landmark Widener Library began a campaign of 
terror-by-mail earlier this year, said Anthony Gemma, the Middlesex County 
assistant district handling the case.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the first letter, mailed to Northeastern's Burlington campus library in 
June, Womack allegedly demanded $ 50,000 to keep him from sending a bomb filled 
with 
&quot;iron shrapnel to inflict the most maximum harm possible.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Womack demanded sums ranging from $ 50,000 to $ 500,000 to $ 1 million in 
letters that ordered the universities to fire all their Jewish employees or 
face a holocaust he planned to unleash, Gemma said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He allegedly sent three other type-written letters to the Burlington campus, 
which put university police on edge given the renewed activity of the 
<strong>UNABOMBER,</strong> a terrorist who has targeted academics since 1978 with letter bombs.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;We've been working closely with the FBI ever since we received the first threat 
last spring,&quot; said D. Joseph Griffin, Northeastern's director of security, where 
investigators broke the case after questioning Womack for book theft.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Authorities also charged him with extortion for a threatening note scribbled on 
a piece of paper towel and left for Widener library employees in 1990, the year 
Womack worked there as a clerk, Gemma said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">On Oct. 7 he sent a letter to his bank, Belmont Savings Bank, threatening the 
institution's president 
&quot;you or your bank will pay me $ 100,000 or you and your Jew family will be 
killed,&quot; Gemma said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Womack could face federal mail fraud and civil rights charges, Gemma said. 
Womack, who lives with his mother, was described by neighbors as 
&quot;a loner&quot; throughout his life.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">They said he was the 
one who discovered his father's body after the man committed suicide 20 years 
ago.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Neighbors never suspected trouble from the tiny house, but noted that Womack - 
who has a criminal record dating back to 1977 - had been arrested before for 
stealing books from town libraries.
