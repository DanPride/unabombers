</p><p class="body" align="Left"> LOS ANGELES - The white supremacist gunman who allegedly wounded children at a 

Jewish community center admitted he later killed a Filipino-American postman 

and said he would kill all nonwhites if he could, the government alleged in 

court papers seeking the death penalty. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Buford O. Furrow Jr. also declared himself to be 

&quot;at war with the Jewish-controlled federal government&quot; and said he hoped others would emulate his actions of August 10, federal 

prosecutors said in a motion filed Tuesday. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 

&quot;The defendant explicitly stated that he is not sorry for his crimes,&quot; they added in filings submitted to US District Judge Nora Manella.  



</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Prosecutors said that two months after his incarceration last summer, Furrow 

threatened to kill a Latino prison inmate and guards assigned to his housing 

unit. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"> In addition, they said, he threatened the life of the woman he referred to as 

his wife and her son, 

&quot;including a threat to deliver the son's head to her on a platter.&quot; 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Furrow is charged with killing letter carrier Joseph Ileto just hours after 

allegedly wounding three boys, a teenage girl, and a woman at the North Valley 

Jewish Community Center. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Furrow has pleaded innocent, and his team of public defenders has launched an 

effort to save him from the death penalty. They have argued that the federal 

death penalty statute is unconstitutional and that the factors presented to 

justify it in the Furrow case were too vague. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Among points in the government briefs was evidence of hate-crime motivation. 

The prosecutors said that after 

Furrow surrendered to the FBI in Las Vegas he told them he had killed Ileto 

because he was not white. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 

&quot;During an interview with law enforcement authorities... the defendant described 

Joseph Santos Ileto as a 'Chink or Spic' and referred to Mr. Ileto as a 'target 

of opportunity' to murder,' 

&quot; the motion said. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Furrow further admitted in the interviews that he wanted to send a message of 

racial hatred and to instill fear in other nonwhite persons across the country, 

the document said. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"> As for the question of whether Furrow would be a future danger, the 

prosecutors said, 

&quot;The defendant stated that if he could kill all nonwhite persons, he would not 

hesitate to do so.&quot; 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Furrow has a history of treatment for mental illness, but the defense has not 

yet said if it will present a mental-illness defense. The lawyers are under 

court order to state their intentions in that regard by 

June 26 and to disclose the names of any experts they may use to show that 

Furrow was not in his right mind at the time of the shootings. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The next hearing on the death penalty issue is scheduled for June 5. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"> A key lawyer on Furrow's defense team is Judy Clarke, a federal public 

defender who handled the 

<strong>Unabomber</strong> case. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Defendant Theodore Kaczynski was allowed to plead guilty and received a life 

sentence after evidence showed he suffered from schizophrenia. Rulings in the 

Kaczynski case were cited in the Furrow case briefs. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The next hearing on the death penalty issue is scheduled for June 5.  </p><br>
