</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> By Indira A.R. Lakshmanan, Globe Staff 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Postal inspectors said yesterday that a package containing a powerful double 
pipe bomb, discovered by a Newton doctor Sunday night as he was opening the 
box, was sent through the mail, not hand-delivered to his house as originally 
suspected.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But investigators remained stymied in their attempts to trace the source of the 
homemade bomb or pin down a motive.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Investigators said they are quite sure, however, that the bomb was not the work 
of someone who has targeted university, computer and airline officials during 
the past two decades.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Paul A. Rosenberg, a doctor at Children's Hospital and an assistant professor 
of neurology at Harvard Medical School, returned from vacation Sunday night and 
began to sort through accumulated mail. It was his unusual method of opening 
the rigged package that probably saved his life, police said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Instead of lifting the side flaps of the box addressed to 
&quot;Mr. Paul Rosenberg, M.D.&quot; and bearing the return address of 
&quot;Union of American Hebrew Congregation&quot; at 1330 Beacon St. in Brookline, Rosenberg took a knife to the package and cut 
around the top of the box, Newton police said. When Rosenberg spotted wires and 
a metal cylinder, he grabbed his wife, ran from the house and called police.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Although investigators are looking into every possibility - including the 
chance that the bomb may have been the work of an anti-Semitic terrorist - 
federal investigators said 
yesterday they think that scenario is unlikely.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Of course they are looking at hate groups,&quot; said Terence McArdle, special agent in charge of the New England office of the 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, 
&quot;but the investigative leads they are pursuing would indicate it is not that.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Today, somebody hates someone for something sooner or later.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">McArdle said the investigation also points away from 
&quot;Unabomb,&quot; a serial bomber who has targeted 14 university professors, computer 
scientists, engineers and one official in the airline industry between May 1978 
and June 1992.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">McArdle said there are no structual similarities between the bomb sent to 
Rosenberg and the sophisticated devices recovered from the Unabomb incidents.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Ed Gleba, public information officer for San Francisco office of the ATF, which 
is investigating a 1992 Unabomb incident at the University of California at San 
Francisco that 
cost a geneticist several fingers, said the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> uses 
&quot;unique&quot; components in his bombs and has signed each with the initials 
&quot;F.C.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Gleba said the Unabombs have arrived in packages the size of a videocassette 
and have been hand-addressed.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Rosenberg's package measured 12-by-10-by-3 inches, and its labels appeared to 
have been made on a copy machine or a laser printer, investigators said.
