</p><p class="body" align="Left">A week that began with a moving memorial service for victims of the Oklahoma 
City federal building bombing ended with authorities still searching for a 
second suspect known as 
&quot;John Doe No. 2&quot; and for an Arizona license plate that had been on captured suspect Timothy 
McVeigh's car. McVeigh is being held for trial without bail. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Searchers continued recovering bodies, with the death toll expected to top 200. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The nation's attention turned also to right-wing extremist and armed militia 
groups, and their anger and hatred of the federal government and preoccupation 
with the fatal Branch Davidian siege near Waco, Texas, two years ago. A debate 
raged over the role and responsibility of radio talk shows.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">President Clinton prodded Congress to move swiftly on his anti- terrorism 
legislation and avoid endless political quibbling over details. Coming up: Hunt 
for bombing perpetrators, search for victims, and anti- terrorism efforts are 
ongoing tasks.

about 200 people were injured. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">JAPANESE CULT: A top official of the Aum Shinri Kyo sect suspected in the Tokyo 
poison gas attack was stabbed to death by a South Korean resident who described 
himself as a rightist.

hiding in an underground room below the sect's headquarters. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Twenty people were sickened by an unidentified gas released outside a 
restaurant near Tokyo. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">BOSNIAN TRIBUNAL: The first international war crimes trial since the end of 
World War II began in The Hague, Netherlands, for a Bosnian Serb former cafe 
owner. Coming up: So-called Contact Group - United States, Russia, France, 
Britain, Germany - to hold more low-level talks this week. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">RWANDA MASSACRE: About 2,000 ethnic Hutus were killed by Rwandan soldiers or 
trampled to death in ensuing stampedes at the Kibeho refugee camp. The Tutsi

after 338 bodies were dug up. 


NATION 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">SERIAL BOMBER: The elusive 
&quot;<strong>Unabomber&quot;</strong> struck again, killing a lumber industry lobbyist with a mail bomb in

group. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">SHABAZZ CASE: A federal magistrate in Minneapolis denied a defense motion to 
dismiss the murder-for-hire charges against Malcolm X's daughter, Qubilah 
Shabazz, but ruled her confession can't be used against her because FBI agents 
entered her home without a warrant. Coming up: Betty Shabazz, Malcolm's widow, 
agreed to meet publicly with Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, whom she 
accuses of involvement in plotting her husband's assassination, at Harlem's 
Apollo Theater on Saturday, May 6. 


WASHINGTON 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">GUN LAW KILLED: The Supreme Court threw out a federal law that bans possession 
of a

enact it. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">High court also cleared the way for Michigan to try Dr. Jack Kevorkian for 
aiding the suicides of terminally ill people. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">TAX OVERHAUL: Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici (R- N.M.) and Sen. 
Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) introduce a bill that would promote savings and investment as 
part of the movement toward tax reform. 


LOCAL 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">NEW AREA CODE: Most area residents and businesses outside the Perimeter will 
have their area code changed from 404 to 770, the state Public Service 
Commission decided Thursday. The ruling will take effect in December. 


SOUTH 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">GUILTY PLEA: Larry Martin Demery, 19, entered a surprise guilty plea in
