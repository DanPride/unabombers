</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Five years ago today Judge Robert S. Vance of the federal court of appeals for 
the 11th circuit opened a package that had just arrived in the mail at his 
suburban home in Birmingham, Alabama; the box contained a powerful bomb which 
killed Judge Vance instantly and gravely injured his wife. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Two days later Robbie S. Robinson, a black city councilman in Savannah, 
Georgia, opened a virtually identical package delivered by mail to his law 
office; both of his arms were blown off in the ensuing explosion, and he died 
three hours later under surgery. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Eighteen months later, Walter Leroy Moody Jr., a small-time con man who lived 
in obscurity in a quiet suburb of Atlanta, was convicted of the mail-bomb 
assassinations. He is 
now under life sentence by a federal court and awaits trial in Birmingham on 
state murder charges which could result in the death penalty. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Because that crime was strikingly similar to the one which took the life of a 
New York advertising executive last Saturday, the investigative authorities no 
doubt are now studying the background of 
&quot;Roy&quot; Moody intensely for clues that might lead to the capture of the so-called 
&quot;<strong>Unabomber,</strong>&quot; whose deadly handiwork has now claimed two lives and injured 23 others over 16 
elusive years.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the course of two years preparing a now-completed book on the Vance-Robinson 
murders, I have gathered a great deal of information on Roy Moody that may shed 
light on the mind and manner of individuals who commit this particular kind of 
random terrorism. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Roy Moody was born in 1934 in a small town in central Georgia. There was a 
history of insanity in the family, on his father's side, and a history of an 
uncommon propensity for violence on his mother's side. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Roy's father was an automobile mechanic who made a decent living during the 
Great Depression of the 1930s, so that the boy did not experience the desperate 
want of so many about him. But from all accounts Roy's father was a cold 
perfectionist, and his mother somewhat demanding. Early 
on Roy demonstrated that he was a bright child, but he lacked the personal 
discipline to achieve his full potential. When he was in the first grade, his 
mother would sit him on her lap for his reading lessons, but if he faltered 
over a word, she would slap him. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">When he was 7 years old, his mother and father went to another state to work in 
a war-production plant, leaving Roy with his grandmother. The child felt a 
sense of abandonment, because he grew sickly that year and had to repeat the 
second grade. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">After the war Roy's father opened his own garage, which prospered. Still, Roy 
nursed a resentment that he was excluded from social acceptance by the town's 
top families. As a high school student, he formed no close friendships with the 
boys of the town. Rather, his closest male friend seems to have been the high 
school science teacher, who doted on Roy. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">During this time Roy developed an enduring pattern of manipulating and 
exploiting younger women. He relied on an especially bright girl, three years 
his junior, to read assigned books and brief him sufficiently that he could 
pass tests. He also impregnated a girl two years younger, and arranged for an 
illegal abortion. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">He joined the Army at least in part to escape his father's entreaties that he 
work in the garage. It was during this time that he began to display a burning 
sense of victimization, a sense that his failures arose from devious acts by 
others. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">He also manifested a tendency for grandiose dreams but an unwillingness to 
exert the effort to achieve his goals. When he returned to Georgia from the 
Army, he enrolled in a small college with the intention of becoming a 
neurosurgeon, but his academic performance was poor. This he blamed on the 
necessity of having to work because his 
father would not pay for his schooling. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">He drifted from job to job, usually sponging off younger women. He married none 
of the four women who bore his children. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In 1972 Roy turned violent; he built a crude pipe-bomb which he intended to 
send to a used-car dealer who had repossessed his car. But before he could mail 
the device, his common-law wife opened the explosive and suffered permanent 
injuries. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">At his trial Roy maintained that the bomb had been brought to his home by a 
mysterious young man he had met at college. His story was persuasive enough to 
win acquittal on a charge of making the bomb, but he was convicted on the 
lesser charge of possessing it, and sentenced to four years in prison. While 
there, he maintained, he was homosexually raped. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Once out of prison, Roy started a scam business that 
kept him in trouble with the postal authorities. Still, he profited enough from 
his scheme that he was able to buy boats, airplanes and a comfortable house in 
an Atlanta suburb. He often quarreled with neighbors, and for the most part 
stayed in his house with a woman young enough to be his daughter. The woman was 
a virtual slave, not only running his scam enterprise but fulfilling his 
omnivorous sexual demands. There is some indication that Roy had homosexual 
relationships as well. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">He began to file large numbers of lawsuits, based on wholly fraudulent claims. 
This propensity verged into paranoia when he blamed the federal courts for 
blocking his ambition to become a lawyer, even though it was clearly his felony 
conviction which precluded any possibility of his gaining admission to the bar. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the throes of bitterness, he concocted an elaborate plan for striking from a 
distance against his 
perceived enemy, the federal judiciary. Robbie Robinson, the black Savannah 
city councilman, was chosen as a victim solely to make the authorities believe 
that the crime was the work of violent white-supremacists. And the ploy might 
have worked had it not been for an alert laboratory technician with the Bureau 
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms who recognized Roy's 
&quot;signature&quot; in the 1989 bombs based on the 1972 bomb. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Roy took great pride in the quality of the bombs he built, from materials 
readily available in seedy gun shops which did not require so much as the 
showing of a driver's license by those who purchased deadly wares. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Even after he was caught, Roy relished matching wits with lawyers and other 
specialists involved in his case. Over the strenuous opposition of his own 
lawyer, he took the stand at his trial to make a meandering, 
lachrymose statement over two days about his victimization. Many found his 
charade to be persuasive, but in face of overwhelming evidence, he was 
convicted. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The enigmatic character of Roy Moody was summed up in a remarkably succinct 
paragraph which concludes a 161-page psychiatric evaluation rendered by the 
noted forensic psychiatrist, Park Elliott Dietz. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Moody's crimes reflect every aspect of his personality,&quot; Dr. Dietz wrote. 
&quot;He used crime as a means of expression and self- definition because he is free 
of societal constraints. He used remote means of destruction and terror out of 
cowardice and cunning. He committed the crimes with great attention to detail 
because of his perfectionism. He committed crimes on a grand scale because of 
his exaggerated sense of self- importance. Finally, he chose victims who could 
not be readily linked to him, yet who represented the classes and institutions 
he blamed for his failures and 
toward whom he harbored the greatest distrust and hostility.&quot;
