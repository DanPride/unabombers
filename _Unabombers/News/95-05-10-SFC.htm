<strong>Unabomber</strong> 



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> Rob Haeseler, Chronicle Staff Writer 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">By targeting scientists prominent in the field of genetics, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> is forcing the Bay Area's big biotechnology industry to think the way he does 
to protect employees from bomb attacks.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Worried that the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> picks his victims from press reports, companies are thinking twice about how 
they and their officers appear in print and how their achievements are 
publicized. Knowing that the killer sometimes mails his package bombs to a 
victim's home, the industry also is seeking ways to make addresses less 
available.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the information age spawned by the computer industry -- another target of 
the anti-technology terrorist -- this is no easy task.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''We are concerned about our officers and families at their homes, particularly 
those who are most visible in the press,'' said a Bay Area biotech executive 
who requested anonymity for himself and his company. ''So what we've done is, 
in essence, find out just how easy it would be for that person to determine 
where they live. We've tried to think like the 
<strong>Unabomber.</strong>''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The revelation this week that the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> sent threatening letters to Boston-area geneticists Richard J. Roberts and 
Phillip A.  Sharp -- who shared the 1993 Nobel Prize for physiology and 
medicine -- sent a chill through some of the 429 biotech-related companies in 
the Bay Area, where the industry sprang to life in the 1970s.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI's UNABOM Task Force in San Francisco confirmed Monday that Roberts, 51, 
received one of four letters mailed 
by the 
<strong>unabomber</strong> in the East Bay on April 20, the same day a package bomb was sent to a timber 
lobbying group in Sacramento, where it killed lobbyist Gilbert Murray.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Boston Herald reported yesterday that Sharp, 50, also received a letter. 
The two scientists were warned to stop their research or face the consequences, 
according to the Herald's unnamed sources.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Citing privacy issues, the FBI would not confirm the Sharp letter yesterday, 
nor would it divulge the contents of the Roberts letter.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A third letter condemning industrial society was sent to the New York Times, 
which published it after deleting sections at the request of the FBI. The 
fourth went to Yale University computer scientist David Gelernter, the victim 
of a 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> package bomb in June 1993.  The blast left Gelernter blind in one eye, 
deaf in one ear and tore off part of his right hand.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Another geneticist, Dr. Charles Epstein of the University of California at San 
Francisco, was seriously injured on June 22, 1993, when opening a package sent 
to his home in Tiburon by the bomber.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Bay Area biotech executive said ''the issue of heightened security began 
after the Tiburon incident.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">These were startling new concerns for an industry whose employees often draw 
yawns when asked their occupations, according to a spokesman for the Bay Area 
Bioscience Center in Oakland.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''Up until now, people have primarily been concerned about theft of 
intellectual property,'' he said, also preferring not to be named.  ''They had 
security so that people couldn't get into buildings and, like other companies, 
they worry about jealous boyfriends . . . and about protesters.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But now, the computer 
age has generated data bases readily available to anyone that give phone 
numbers and addresses nationwide.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''This guy (the 
<strong>Unabomber)</strong> does not have to have a lot of smarts,'' said the spokesman for the center, 
''and there is no reason he is going to be intellectually consistent in his 
opposition to computer technology and his use of it. He probably is very good 
technically.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">As for potential targets, he said, ''the likelihood is that some of these 
people never got approached by the press in their life, until they got the 
Nobel Prize. They can walk down the street and no one would recognize them.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Roberts and Sharp won the prize for their independent discovery in 1977 of 
''split genes,'' which helped scientists learn how some cancers and hereditary 
diseases develop.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Roberts received his letter at New England Biolabs in Beverly, Mass. Its 
address is listed in his biography in Who's Who in America.  
Like several of the other 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> targets, he lives on a street named after a tree.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Over the past 17 years, the bomber's devices have killed three people and 
injured 23 in 16 incidents.
