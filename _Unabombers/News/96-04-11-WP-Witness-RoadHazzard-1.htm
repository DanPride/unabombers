Utah Investigator Says Woman Saw Clean-Shaven Man Put Object Near Car

</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>

</p><p class="body" align="Left">An eyewitness who gave authorities their only physical description of the
elusive <strong>Unabomber</strong> is unlikely to be able to positively <strong>identify</strong>
suspect Theodore J. Kaczynski -- if he is the same man -- unless his beard is
shaved off before he is put in a lineup, a Salt Lake City Police investigator
who has worked on the case for nine years said today. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Officer Kyle Jones, the department's Unabomb Task Group case manager, said he
has seen two photographs of Kaczynski since the Lincoln, Mont., recluse was
arrested and believes he is a &quot;plausible look-alike,&quot; based on his
interviews of the only eyewitness. But Jones said in an interview that without seeing
Kaczynski clean shaven he could not be certain. 
<a name="Witness"></a></p><p class="body" align="Left">
&quot;He certainly is in the same ballpark, the same realm. He has the same
reddish blond hair, but without seeing him without the beard, it's hard to
say,&quot; Jones said. Variable factors like hair color and skin color sometime
make identifications after such a long period more difficult, he said. 
<a href="http://www.unabombers.com/GovernmentBehaviors.htm#Witness">
Jones said he has not talked with the FBI since Kaczynski's arrest but assumes
federal agents are trying to keep the <strong>witness,</strong> a woman, from
being &quot;contaminated&quot; by exposure to media coverage of Kaczynski's
arrest, including photographs and videotapes of the suspect. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
He described the woman as &quot;very intelligent and very cooperative,&quot;
and said he assumed the FBI will try to arrange a lineup or some other
identification process.</a> That could raise legal issues of whether Kaczynski
could be forced to shave off his beard before participating in the lineup,
Jones said. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
On the morning of Feb. 20, 1987, the young woman, an employee of the CAAMS Inc.
computer store near the University of Utah, was staring absently out of a rear
window when she saw a strange man pull a wooden object out of a laundry bag and
place it beside a car in the parking lot.

Jones said the woman, who no longer lives in the Salt Lake City area and whose
identity is being withheld by the police and the FBI, stood &quot;just a matter
of feet&quot; from the man, who was wearing a hooded gray sweat shirt and
sunglasses. The Chicago Tribune and San Francisco Examiner, citing an
unidentified law enforcement official, said aviator sunglasses and a sweat
shirt were found Tuesday in Kaczynski's cabin. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
<a href="http://www.unabombers.com/#BombParts">The object the man deposited
looked like short lengths of 2-by-4 boards nailed together, with nails
protruding from the board. Jones said the device, which concealed a pipe bomb,
was designed to look like construction debris. </a>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
&quot;It was designed to look like a road hazard. That's what makes it so
distinctive from most of the other bombs, because it was not individual
specific,&quot; Jones said. Most of the other bombs, he said, were packages
addressed to specific individuals. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
The woman employee remarked to another employee that she thought someone was
trying to flatten tires of cars that drove into the parking lot, but then the
two workers became distracted by a telephone and moved away from the window. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Minutes later, their boss, Gary Wright, 26, drove into the lot, saw the object
and kicked it. An explosion ripped through the lot, lacerating his arms, face
and legs and leaving him with impaired function of one hand. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
&quot;The device was placed so that someone had to move it, but it didn't seem
to matter to him who it was,&quot; Jones said. &quot;This case was particularly
unusual because it was a device anyone could have interacted with. Also, it was
the first and only time he had been seen.&quot;
