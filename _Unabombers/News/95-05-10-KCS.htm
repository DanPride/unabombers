Media's 'loud and angry voices' prompt debate over possible power of rhetoric

</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Sticks and stones may break my bones but names can never hurt me.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">So goes a childhood saying.  But is it so?
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the wake of the April 19 Oklahoma City bombing, the debate
over 
&quot;names&quot; and the power of rhetoric is raging.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">On April 25, as President Clinton offered words of solace to a
grieving nation, he also denounced those whom he called the
&quot;purveyors of hatred,&quot; the 
&quot;loud and angry voices&quot; of division, and
individuals who use the airwaves 
&quot;to keep some people as paranoid
as possible and the rest of us all torn up and upset with each
other. 
&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Clinton never pinpointed the targets of his comments.  But many
have come to view them as attacks mostly on conservative radio
talk-show personalities such as Rush Limbaugh, G. Gordon Liddy,
Oliver North and radical populist Chuck Harder, all fierce critics
of the Clinton presidency and the federal government.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">That some of their words on these and other topics are
inflammatory is hardly in debate.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Limbaugh calls feminists 
&quot;femi-nazis. 
&quot; Liddy recently advised
his listeners to shoot at the heads of federal agents, should
agents ever raid their homes.  Harder suggests there is a conspiracy
to turn America into a feudal state and working people into serfs.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Provocative?  Certainly.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But do such words actually affect society's mood, as Clinton
implies?  Is this negative rhetoric so powerful as to create
negative behavior?
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Or are these 
&quot;loud and angry voices&quot; simply exercising the First
Amendment as the Founding Fathers truly intended?  Are they 
any
different from Patrick Henry, who inflamed the colonies when he
said, 
&quot;Give me liberty or give me death! 
&quot;?
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Indeed, their voices may be critical, conservative, even
extreme.  But many argue that, historically, they are no more
divisive and no more angry than the voices from the left that in
the 1960s challenged the status quo, helped to end the war in
Vietnam and forever changed the nature of the country.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">That, at least, is the debate.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Robert Rowland, a professor of communications and rhetorical
criticism at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, believes that
President Clinton 
&quot;is exactly on target. 
&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;People on talk radio may not be saying, 'Go out and throw
bombs,' 
&quot; he said.  
&quot;But there is a tendency for human beings to
take the seeds of an idea and run with it. 
&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Aristotle, he said, believed that within every acorn was the
essence of the oak.  So when radio 
personalities suggest American
culture and American policies are not what they ought to be, some
listeners are apt to take those notions even further.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">To certain individuals, Rowland said, 
&quot;liberals that advocate
mild gun control become people who want to destroy the Constitution
and run your lives. 
&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Feminists become strident women bent on denying the laws of
nature.  Affirmative action becomes a federal policy aimed at
robbing white males of their jobs.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Many commentators, of course, argue that they are not
responsible for the warped interpretation of their words.  But David
Frank, a University of Oregon professor who is an expert on the
role of rhetoric during the Holocaust, believes that argument is
false.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The assumption,&quot; he said, 
&quot;is that what I say and what I do may
not be related, that telling a broad audience what to think and how
to think has no relation to what they do.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;There is no 
direct causal relationship between what someone
says and what happens in society.  But words provide the
fertilization and form the ground on which people use to make
judgments.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The rhetoric and the language that people use affect the way
people perceive the world and the way they act in the world. 
&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School of
Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, agrees to an
extent.  But she does not think inflammatory radio rhetoric played
much, if any, role in the recent bombing.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I don't think that talk radio has any direct effect on people's
behavior,&quot; she said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Extremists are extremists.  Nuts are nuts.  Jamieson said she
doubts members of potentially dangerous groups are getting their
ideas by 
&quot;sitting around and listening to talk radio. 
&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;People,&quot; she said, 
&quot;tend to listen to media that reflect what
they already believe. 
&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But that, George 
Kennedy says, is precisely the problem.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Kennedy, an expert in speech and communications at the
University of North Carolina, contends that negative rhetoric
becomes truly dangerous when it is constant, intense, and
unchallenged; when 
&quot;angry voices&quot; become the only voices some
individuals choose to hear.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I'm not a big fan of Clinton, but I thought there was an
element of truth in what he said,&quot; Kennedy said.  
&quot;That the
shrillness of it all could be dangerous. 
&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Still, the First Amendment guarantees all manner of discourse.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">William S. Golem of Overland Park, an electrical engineer who
enjoys conservative talk radio commentators such as Rush Limbaugh,
asserts that rhetoric is not to blame.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Golem believes that conservative commentary is being tied
unfairly to the actions of extremists by a president trying to
score political points against his critics.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Citizens, he said, should have the 
right to protest, even
intensely, without having their words held responsible for
extremists who may use them to justify violence.  Furthermore, he
says, inflammatory rhetoric swings left and right.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Liberals have seen this as an opportunity to shut down debate
and shut up people who disagree with them,&quot; Golem said.  
&quot;But if you
want to talk about anger and hate out there, just look at the
rhetoric being used by the left attacking the Contract With
America, Newt Gingrich, the Republicans. 
&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Newspapers, Golem said, 
&quot;have run letter after letter comparing
Republicans to Nazis and the Holocaust.  That insane rhetoric is
just pure hate. 
&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Moreover, he said, if one is going to tie the Oklahoma City
bombing to right-wing rhetoric, the whole 1960s should be blamed
for causing the Black Panthers and the Weathermen Underground
bombings, and all abortion protesters should be held accountable
for 
slayings by abortion providers.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">More recently he cites the case of the so-called 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> the
radical environmentalist who has killed three people and sent
myriad letter bombs to those he has opposed over the last 17 years.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;You have to ask,&quot; said Golem referring to the bomber's last
victim, 
&quot;was all this anti-big business, radical environmental
rhetoric of the Sierra Club responsible for driving this guy to
blow up the timber company executive? 
&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Finally, Golem said, he is less concerned about inflammatory
rhetoric than he is about the chilling effect Clinton's and others'
comments could have on free speech.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;What exactly are they suggesting? 
&quot; he asked.  
&quot;That you're not
allowed to criticize the government? 
&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Of course not, experts say.  No one doubts the importance of
pointed, even intense criticism.  And most experts agree that
bombastic, incendiary rhetoric is as common on the left as it is on
the right.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Which is why 
even strong advocates of free speech say that
perhaps it is time to dilute the vitriol and get back to reasonable
discussion.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;What we need,&quot; said Frank, 
&quot;is to recast the way we talk and
argue.  We need to move away from the demonization of those who
disagree with us and have the kind of discourse that is designed to
solve problems instead of waging war. 
&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Or as Woody Cozad, a lawyer and conservative Kansas City radio
commentator, said, paraphrasing New York political columnist Nat
Hentoff:
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The remedy to stupid speech is intelligent speech in response.
