</p><p class="body" align="Left">WASHINGTON Medicare will run as much as $ 165 billion short of what it needs to pay 
hospital bills over the next decade, the head of the Senate Finance Committee 
said yesterday. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.) said the only ways to avert the shortfall are to 
raise taxes, which nobody proposes doing, or to 
&quot;slow the growth of Medicare from its current 10 per cent-plus to something more 
like 7%&quot; a year. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">But Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala told Packwood, 
&quot;We cannot destroy Medicare in order to save it.&quot; BOSTON The deadly 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> sent letters to two Nobel Prize winning scientists, warning them to give up 
their work in genetics and computers as he was preparing to strike again.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI said Richard Roberts, who is head of research for New England Biolabs 
in Beverly, Mass., received one of four letters apparently sent by the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> April 20. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Boston Herald quoted unnamed sources as saying that another letter was sent 
to Phillip Sharp, 51, head of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's 
biology department. WASHINGTON The Senate approved a proposal to reshape the 
nation's product-liability laws yesterday, but backed off from an earlier 
version that would have limited punitive damages in all lawsuits. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The new proposal would limit punitive damage awards by juries hearing 
product-liability cases but would let judges override those limits in many 
instances. PUERTO CABANAS, Cuba A Coast Guard cutter returned 13 Cuban refugees 
to their homeland yesterday, the first group of 
rafters to be repatriated under a new U.S. policy bitterly denounced by 
Cuban-Americans. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Cubans, all men ages 28 to 45, had been picked up from two wooden boats by 
a passing cruise ship last week. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Clinton administration announced last week that rafters would be returned 
to the island instead of routinely granted political asylum. WASHINGTON The 
Senate voted yesterday to install John Deutch as the new CIA director. Deutch, 
a chemist, is to be sworn in as the 17th director of the CIA today.
