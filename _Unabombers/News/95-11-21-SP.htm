</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> Andrea Stone, USA Today 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Whether seen in the rubble of Oklahoma, along the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> elusive trail or in a mailbox charred by a teenager's prank, the number of 
bombings in America has exploded, leaving an unnerving trail of random terror.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">None of the new wave of bombings has wrought anything close to the devastation 
of the Oklahoma City bomb or New York's World Trade Center blast two years ago.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But, says the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, bombings did 
increase 76 percent from 1989 to 1993, the latest year available.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Analysts blame society's overall tide of violence, the spread of bomb-making 
information, the easy availability of raw materials, even big-budget action 
movies, for the jump to more than 2,400 bombings.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The vast majority of bombs are small homemade affairs, which injure no one but 
are still capable of ripping open a locker or starting fires.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">By far the top inducement for bombers is vandalism - capricious or malicious. 
Revenge comes next. Protest bombings against the federal government, abortion 
clinics or other political targets may garner big headlines but actually make 
up a small proportion of incidents.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Culture, not ideology, appears to fuels the bombmaker's craft.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Our appetite for the fantasy of explosions is rather profound, almost like this 
primal interest in fire,&quot; says Lawrence Myers, a bomb 
researcher.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The appeal of explosives is simple, says American University criminologist 
Ronald Weiner. 
&quot;They go 'boom.' They make a real big impression.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">As an attention-getter, 
&quot;Bombs represent enormous power,&quot; says Brian Jenkins, a security consultant. 
&quot;To have control over this enormous power is an attraction, especially to 
adolescent males.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Post-pubescent males, ages 15 to 22, are most likely to experiment with 
explosives, Myers says.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">This is the same age group that helped make Sylvester Stallone's 
&quot;The Specialist,&quot; about an ex-CIA bomb expert out for revenge, second on the movie rental chart 
last week. They, and many of their elders, have crowded theaters to see 
&quot;Blown Away&quot; and 
&quot;Speed,&quot; movies in which bombs and their destructive effects are featured.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">From TV's 
&quot;Hogan's Heroes&quot; to Tom Clancy novels, 
&quot;the context is one of a culture that is deeply 
involved in violence and tends to celebrate that violence in the media,&quot; says Charles Strozier of the Center on Violence and Human Survival at John Jay 
College.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;There is an increase in the willingness of individuals to use more extreme 
forms of violence to make their point,&quot; says Weiner. 
&quot;Sometimes it's not clear what those points are.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Not that bombings are new.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The eight-year reign of New York's 
&quot;Mad Bomber,&quot; George Metesky, did as much to hurt Manhattan's theater business in the 1950s 
as did the new technology of television. In the 1970s, the left-wing Weather 
Underground and Puerto Rican nationalists were linked to a series of bombings. 
The still-loose 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> who has killed three and injured 23, began his reign of terror in 1978.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">And, analysts say, bombings tend to be cyclical, with peaks and valleys over 
time. 
&quot;Bombings feed upon themselves,&quot; 
Myers says, with copycats always a threat. The latest example: the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> attack in Sacramento, which experts say not by accident came on the heels of 
the Oklahoma tragedy.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The rising bombing statistics represent another trend, though. They underscore 
a softening of civility in a nation overcome by economic uncertainty, says Paul 
Ragonese, a former New York police bomb squad member. 
&quot;Instead of talking, they're yelling, they're threatening,&quot; he says. 
&quot;There seems to be no negotiation but detonation.&quot;
