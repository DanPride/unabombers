CHOKING CHECHNYA; CARTER ON CALL 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">On Sunday, Russian President Boris Yeltsin ordered troops into the breakaway 
Muslim region of Chechyna, in the southern Caucasus area. The Chechens, who 
have long resisted rule by Moscow, fought a drawn-out war against Russia in the 
last century. Russia has promised not to storm the region's capital, Grozny, a 
city of 400,000 people. Instead it plans to blockade the city to put pressure 
on the Chechens to retract their 1991 independence declaration.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Former President Carter said on Wednesday that Bosnian Serb leaders had asked 
him to travel to the region to help negotiate a peace settlement. President 
Clinton told Carter he would not stand in the way of his going, but any visit 
would be in a purely private capacity; Carter would not be representing the 
United States. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">On Friday, Defense Secretary William Perry announced that the United States is 
sending 3,000 Marines to waters off Somalia in the event Clinton decides to aid 
in the upcoming withdrawal of United Nations forces from that country.

Nation TACKLING TAXES; A BOMBER STRIKES AGAIN; FABLES OF FAUBUS
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Last week Democrats continued their awkward efforts to accommodate themselves 
to the new Washington order. On Tuesday, House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt 
(D-Mo.) proposed a middle-class tax cut in a speech to a Washington think tank. 
He called for an across-the-board cut for families making under $ 75,000. In a 
nationally televised address Thursday night, President Clinton offered a 
proposal of his own. Calling for a 
&quot;middle-class Bill of Rights,&quot; 
Clinton announced his backing for $ 60 billion in tax cuts, which would be paid 
for with deep cuts in five federal departments and agencies. Republicans 
hammered both Democratic proposals as being copycat measures. In the GOP 
response to the president's speech, Senator-elect Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.) said, 
&quot;From what we heard tonight, the president's vision for the future now looks a 
lot like what Republicans just campaigned for.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">On Sunday, federal investigators in New Jersey said a bomb that the day before 
had killed a prominent advertising executive, Thomas J. Mosser, had been the 
work of a serial bomber who has struck 15 times since 1978. Dubbed 
&quot;<strong>Unabom&quot;</strong> because of his frequent preference for individuals affiliated with 
universities, the bomber has now killed two men and wounded 23 other people.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">It was revealed last week that former US Sen. Paul Tsongas has begun 
circulating a nine-page memorandum suggesting the nation's problems would best 
be addressed by a centrist third party led by a presidential candidate such as 
former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell. 
&quot;The currency here would be moral authority, the kind of moral authority the 
administration clearly does not have and that the Republican 'Contract with 
America' cannot provide,&quot; Tsongas said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Orval Faubus, who overcame rural poverty to win six terms as governor of 
Arkansas, only to find himself far better known for his opposition to civil 
rights, died Wednesday. He was 84 and had been suffering from bone and prostate 
cancer. Faubus' defiance of a federal desegregation order in 1957 brought about 
a school crisis in Little Rock and ushered in an 
era of Southern resistance to integration when President Eisenhower responded 
by ordering troops to enforce the order. Not previously regarded as a race 
baiter, Faubus nonetheless found himself linked by historians to such 
obstructionist governors as Mississippi's Ross Barnett, Alabama's George 
Wallace and Georgia's Lester Maddox.

Metro/Region PLAZA SWEET? A BIT OF THE BLARNEY
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> On Monday, Mayor Menino announced five first-place winners in a competition to 
revamp City Hall Plaza, which has long daunted pedestrians with its uninviting 
brick expanse. The competition attracted 190 entries, with entrants ranging 
from design professionals to schoolchildren.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Gov. Weld spent last week in Ireland, Northern Ireland and England, heading a 
70-member trade delegation promoting business investment in Massachusetts. 
Joining him overseas were Senate President William 
Bulger and House Speaker Charles Flaherty. All three men have come under fire 
for their part in passing a legislative pay raise and capital gains tax cut 
this month, and the fortuitousness of their absence on this trip did not go 
unremarked.

Health/Science TEENS TAKING DRUGS
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> A new nationwide study released last week found that teen-agers' use of 
illegal drugs continues to grow. The survey of 50,000 students at 420 public 
and private high schools found that nearly 31 percent of seniors had smoked 
marijuana during the past year and 3.6 percent had used cocaine. Still, the 
levels of drug use are markedly lower than those found in the late 1970s and 
early '80s. The survey was conducted by the University of Michigan's Institute 
for Social Research.

Learning PRESIDENTIAL TIMBER
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> On Tuesday, 
it was learned that a Boston University committee is expected to recommend that 
Jon Westling succeed John Silber when he retires as president at a yet-to-be 
determined date. Westling, 52, was appointed BU's provost in 1983 and executive 
vice president in 1988. A former Rhodes scholar, he has twice served as acting 
president. Westling lacks a doctorate, which is rare for a president of a 
leading university; and BU's faculty council is likely to protest any selection 
of a president without a national search. But neither obstacle should stand in 
the way of Westling's eventual selection.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">On Thursday, Smith College named Ruth Simmons, vice provost at Princeton 
University, as its ninth president. The daughter of Texas sharecroppers, she 
has also served as provost of Spelman College in Atlanta. Simmons, 49, is the 
first black to 
become president of a Seven Sisters college. She takes office July 1.

In their own words
</p><p class="body" align="Left">At a Washington press conference on Thursday, Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) 
introduced a plan to cut $ 124 billion in taxes over the next five years. He 
also discussed the tax cut proposal President Clinton would be announcing that 
night in his nationally televised broadcast.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I think everybody realizes that this is the same person that two years ago was 
talking exactly the same way, and when he took office he not only did not 
propose a tax cut for working families, but he raised their taxes. So I believe 
in redemption. If the president heard the voice of the people on Nov. 8 and he 
wants to get on the train and be the engineer, great. If he wants to wave 
goodbye to us at the 
station, we can wave back. And if he wants to stand in the middle of the tracks 
and try to stop the train, we can live with that. But in any case, I think the 
president has got to decide what he wants to do.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The point I wanted to make clear is I am glad that the president is beginning 
to at least hum along as we sing our song of less government and more freedom. 
And to the extent that he will cooperate, I certainly am more than willing to 
share with him the credit for what we do and certainly listen to his ideas. But 
if the best he can do is $ 30 billion of tax cuts over a five-year period when 
the government is spending $ 1.5 trillion a year . . . clearly that is not 
going to be enough. That is a day late and a dollar short.
