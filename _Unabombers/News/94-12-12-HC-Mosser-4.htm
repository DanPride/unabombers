</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">NORTH CALDWELL, N.J. -- Federal officials said Sunday that
a mail bomb that killed a prominent advertising executive on
Saturday was sent by the same man who has mounted a string of
similar attacks since 1978, striking targets across the corporate
and academic landscape in one of the most notorious unsolved crime
sprees in the nation's recent history.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The death of the executive in this wealthy suburb about 15
miles from New York City deepened the mystery of the bomber.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The suspect, described as an anarchist with a mastery of
explosives and a grudge against the influence of technology on
society, has long eluded a team of federal investigators that has
roamed from Connecticut to California.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">With the death on Saturday, the bomber, dubbed 
&quot;&quot;<strong>unabom'</strong>'
because in the past he had seemed to want to torment universities
and airlines, has now killed two men and wounded 23 other people in
15 attacks.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Officials said at a news conference Sunday that they had
concluded that the explosion that killed the executive, Thomas
Mosser, 50, was related to the earlier ones because the bomb was
built with similar materials and had a similar, sophisticated
design.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But once again, they said they were not exactly certain what
connected Mosser to the other victims.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;&quot;The components of the bomb, its construction, make us
believe the bombs are linked,'' said Barry Mawn, the head of the
FBI's Newark office.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mawn said there was nothing to indicate that Mosser was
involved with organized crime or had been a witness in a criminal
trial.  Nor, Mawn said, were there any threats made against him or
his family.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mawn said that from one briefsighting of the 
suspect in 1987
in Salt Lake City and shards of evidence gathered at bomb scenes,
the FBI had developed a likely profile of him.  It identified him as
a recluse, a white man in his late 30s or 40s with a high school
education who is familiar with university life.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The investigation into the bomber, who apparently mails his
packages from northern California, had stalled in the early 1990s
until he resurfaced last year, maiming one professor in New Haven,
another in California.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">After those incidents, investigators disclosed that he
usually leaves the initials 
&quot;&quot;FC'' engraved on his bombs.  Officials
said Sunday that they had not yet determined whether those initials
were on the bomb that killed Mosser.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The earliest victims of the attacks were airline executives.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Those wounded in recent years have been scholars who have made
significant advances in computer 
sciences, psychology and genetics.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mosser, who was promoted to executive vice president earlier
this year and recently was named general manager as well at Young 
&amp;
Rubicam, one of the largest advertising firms in the world, appears
to be the first victim in advertising.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bomber sent a letter to The Times last year, postmarked
Sacramento, Calif., identifying the author as a 
&quot;&quot;an anarchist
group calling ourselves FC. '' The letter promised to 
&quot;&quot;give
information about our goals at some future time,'' a suggestion
taken by investigators to mean that the suspect intended to attack
again.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Investigators said they had not yet determined where the
package originated.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The explosion tore a hole through a kitchen counter, broke
windows and filled the room with smoke.  Mosser was declared dead at
the scene, and was apparently decapitated by a bomb that appeared
to be 
stronger than any of those mailed to earlier victims,
officials said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Federal agencies have set up a $ 1 million reward fund for
information leading to the arrest of the suspect.  Their hot line
number is (800) 701-BOMB.
