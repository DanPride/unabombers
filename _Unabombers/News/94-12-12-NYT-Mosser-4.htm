F.B.I. Says Fatal Mail Blast Is Work of Serial Bomber 



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> 
By CLIFFORD J. LEVY, 
Special to The New York Times 



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>DATELINE:</strong> NORTH CALDWELL, N.J., Dec. 11 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Federal officials said today that a mail bomb that killed a prominent 
advertising executive here on Saturday was sent by the same man who has mounted 
a string of similar attacks since 1978, striking targets across the corporate 
and academic landscape in one of the most notorious unsolved crime sprees in 
the nation's recent history.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The death of the executive in this wealthy suburb about 15 miles from New York 
City deepened the mystery of the bomber. The suspect, described as an anarchist 
with a mastery of explosives and a grudge against the influence of technology 
in society, has long eluded a team of Federal investigators that has roamed 
from Connecticut to California trying to track him down.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> With the death on Saturday, the bomber, dubbed 
&quot;<strong>unabom&quot;</strong> because in the past he had seemed to want to torment universities and 
airlines, has now killed two men and wounded 23 other people in 15 attacks that 
are growing increasingly violent, officials said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The officials said at a news conference today in Newark that they had concluded 
that the explosion that killed the executive, Thomas J. Mosser, 50, was related 
to the earlier ones because the bomb was built with similar materials and had a 
similar, sophisticated design. But once again, they said they were not exactly 
certain what connected Mr. Mosser to the other victims.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The components of the bomb, its construction, make us believe the bombs are 
linked,&quot; said Barry Mawn, the head of the F.B.I.'s Newark office.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mr. Mawn said there was nothing to indicate that Mr. Mosser was involved with 
organized crime or had been a witness in a criminal 
trial. Nor, Mr. Mawn said, were there any threats made against him or his 
family.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mr. Mawn said that from one brief sighting of the suspect and shards of 
evidence gathered at bomb scenes, the F.B.I. had developed a likely profile of 
him. It identified him as a recluse, a white man in his late 30's or 40's with 
a high school education who is familiar with university life.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Investigators believe that he prides himself on the intricate construction of 
his bombs, crafting and polishing parts by hand even though they can be bought 
at a hardware store. In doing so, the suspect makes it harder to trace where 
the parts came from.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The investigation into the bomber, who apparently mails his packages from 
northern California, had stalled in the early 1990's until he resurfaced last 
year, maiming one professor in 
New Haven and another in California. After those incidents, investigators 
disclosed that he usually leaves the initials 
&quot;FC&quot; engraved on his bombs. Officials said today that they had not yet determined 
whether those initials were on the bomb that killed Mr. Mosser.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The earliest victims of the attacks were airline executives. Those wounded in 
recent years have been scholars who have made significant advances in computer 
sciences, psychology and genetics. Mr. Mosser, who was promoted to executive 
vice president earlier this year and recently was named general manager as well 
at Young 
&amp; Rubicam, one of the largest advertising firms in the world, appears to be the 
first victim in advertising.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mr. Mawn said investigators were examining the client list of Young 
&amp; Rubicam and its public-relations subsidiary, Burson-Marsteller, for which Mr. 
Mosser served as chief operating officer until he was promoted. Young 
&amp; Rubicam has 
some technology clients, including the Digital Equipment Corporation and Xerox. 
It also works for the United States Postal Service, Philip Morris, KFC, Kraft 
General Foods and several other conglomorates.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Investigators said one reason Mr. Mosser might also be linked to the other 
victims was that he was mentioned recently in The New York Times. At least 
three of the other victims, including the two last year, had been featured in 
articles in The Times that characterized them as leaders in their fields. An 
article describing Mr. Mosser's promotion appeared in The Times on Dec. 5.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mr. Mosser's address and phone number are listed in the local telephone 
directory.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bomber sent a letter to The Times last year, postmarked Sacramento, Calif., 
identifying the author as 
&quot;an anarchist group calling ourselves FC.&quot; The letter promised to 
&quot;give information about our goals at some future time,&quot; a suggestion taken by investigators to mean that the suspect intended to 
attack again.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Senior law-enforcement officials said today that they hoped that the bomber 
would again communicate with The Times or another newspaper about the most 
recent incident because it might provide clues as to what had happened.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mr. Mosser was killed about 11 A.M. on Saturday at his home on 15 Aspen Drive 
when he opened a package the size of a videocassette that had been addressed to 
him, Mr. Mawn said. The package had been delivered on Friday in the regular 
mail and was handled repeatedly by Mr. Mosser's wife and at least one of his 
children before he opened it a day later, while alone in his kitchen.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Investigators said they had not yet determined where the package originated. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The explosion tore 
a hole through a kitchen counter, broke windows and filled the room with smoke. 
Mr. Mosser was declared dead at the scene, and was apparently decapitated by a 
bomb that appeared to be stronger the any of those mailed to earlier victims, 
officials said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;It didn't sound like something had fallen, it sounded serious,&quot; said Robin Sommese, 13, who was in the house, along with several other 
children, for a party when the bomb exploded. 
&quot;There was no fire, but there was plenty of smoke.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The only known sighting of the bomber was in Salt Lake City in 1987, when a 
witness saw a man place a bomb behind a computer store, said Rick Smith, a 
spokesman for the F.B.I. office in San Francisco, which has a task force of 25 
investigators and support personnel that is 
spearheading the investigation. The bomber was described as a white man with a 
ruddy complexion and blond to red hair. He was wearing a hooded sweatshirt.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The first 12 bombings occurred from 1978 to 1987, beginning in Evanston, Ill., 
and ending in Salt Lake City. The suspect then took a six-year hiatus for 
unknown reasons, officials said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Before the letter sent to The Times, the bomber had never explained his 
motives, though in a few instances he had sent messages to his victims in the 
weeks before he attacked. He sent a letter to an airline executive, telling him 
to read a book that would be arriving in the mail. He asked a professor to read 
a forthcoming manuscript.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Federal agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Postal 
Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, have set up a $1 
million 
reward fund for information leading to the arrest of the suspect. The phone 
number is (800) 701-BOMB.
