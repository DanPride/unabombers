<a href="http://www.unabombers.com/#Patents">NASA officials, concerned that the so-called Unabomber might target
agency scientists, this week told the FBI to remove a computer file that was
set up as the first &quot;Wanted&quot; poster in cyberspace.</a>
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 

The FBI's Unabom file, accessible over the Internet, was created in the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's computer in December 1993 to
solicit tips in the frustrating case. The Unabom file, which was the first
known use of the Internet in a major criminal investigation, offers a $1
million reward for clues leading to the arrest of the elusive suspect who since
1978 has killed three and injured 23 in attacks from New Jersey to California. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
The document, which can be read by any computer user with access to the World
Wide Web, will be accessible at a new address after it is moved to a Justice
Department computer. It includes a sketch of the bomber and recounts the case's
chronology. The file indicates it was last updated in March. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
In a phone conversation Thursday, Dr. David Cooper of NASA's Ames Research
Center in California told FBI Special Agent Joel Moss that the FBI must remove
the file by June 30 because space agency officials fear its presence might
provoke the bomber to attack their scientists, according to an internal FBI
memo. Previous <strong>Unabomber</strong> victims have included a number of
scientists and professors. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
Neither Cooper nor Moss would say yesterday whether the <strong>Unabomber</strong>
had made specific threats against any NASA scientists. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
&quot;This is a sensitive issue here, and I've been advised not to comment on
any of this matter until more time goes by,&quot; Cooper said. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
NASA also told the FBI that agents working on the Unabom case may no longer
receive e-mail about the case at the agency's Internet address and must remove
any case files from NASA computers, according to the memo. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
Moss declined to comment. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
The FBI will move the <strong>Unabomber</strong> file and another public file
with information about last month's bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma
City to a computer run by the Justice Department, a NASA spokesman said. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
&quot;We helped them get it set up and running, because we have a lot of
expertise with computers and the Internet,&quot; said Brian Welch, NASA
spokesman. &quot;But we don't have any involvement in the case, and it makes
sense for them to be on a Department of Justice&quot; computer. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
Welch said that NASA has helped other government entities - including the White
House - to create public files on the World Wide Web that later were moved to
other computers. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
Currently, a computer user who wants to read the FBI's <strong>Unabomber</strong>
page would use a software program called a web browser that connects to files
on the World Wide Web. The address of the FBI page, until the end of June, is
http://naic.nasa.gov/fbi/ 
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
Officials said they do not yet know what the new address will be.
