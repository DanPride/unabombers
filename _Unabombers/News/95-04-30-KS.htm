</p><p class="body" align="Left">Americans should 
&quot;quit throwing stones&quot; at one another over the
Oklahoma City bombing, Iran-contra figure Oliver North said Saturday
night.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">North, who spoke at Johnson County Community College, also
disputed the notion that the bombing was the work of domestic
terrorists.  The 
&quot;despicable act&quot; didn't have a political goal, one
of the requirements of terrorism, he said.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;We have to step back and stop throwing stones at each otherand
remain absolutely steadfast to the principles contained in this
document,&quot; he said, holding up a copy of the U.S.  Constitution.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">At a news conference before his speech, North described the
bombing as 
&quot;pathological criminal behavior. 
&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;It's the same as what the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> is,&quot; the former National
Security aide said.  
&quot;The same as the assassin who tried to kill
Ronald Reagan.  And it should be dealt with as such. 
&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">North, who recently started his own syndicated radio talk show,
denounced President Clinton's treatment of the explosion.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I commended the president for three days on my show on how he
handled the tragedy,&quot; North said to reporters.  
&quot;But by Sunday night
he received some bad political advice.  He tried to capitalize and
make political hay over the tragedy, which was a terrible mistake. 
&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">North said Clinton encouraged the nation to 
&quot;make a minor
departure from American civil liberties&quot; because of the bombing.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">If Reagan had said something similar after he was shot, North
said, 
&quot;you guys (the media) would have gone nuts. 
&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">North spoke for about 30 minutes to a crowd of more than 800
people who stood and applauded after his introduction, after his
speech and after his question-and-answer session.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Now I know why Bob Dole is from Kansas,&quot; he said about the warm
reception.  
&quot;I should have come out here to run. 
&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Most of North's speech focused on his plan to change government
by cutting taxes and reforming welfare.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I'm tired of a government who taxes, taxes, taxes,&quot; he said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Who punishes success and invests in failureWhat we want as
conservatives is a government who takes less, spends less and
intrudes less. 
&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Displaying a copy of the Constitution, North said: 
&quot;He wrote to
promote the general welfare, you'll note he didn't say to provide
welfare generally. 
&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">North, who came under fire from Congress for his part in the
Iran-contra affair, said that although 
&quot;others can't get beyond
that,&quot; it is not the most important part of his life.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">North was criticized for his role in a secret deal to sell
missiles to Iran in exchange for the release of American hostages
in Lebanon.  Money from the weapons sales was then funneled to the
contras in Nicaragua.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Everyone, in time, will come to a point where they have to make
a decision between bad and worse,&quot; he said about his actions.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">North, who ran unsuccessfully last year for a U.S. Senate seat
in Virginia, said he doesn't plan to run 
for office again until
1999, after his youngest daughter graduates from high school.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Until then, he said, he would be campaigning for the office of
&quot;husband and father&quot; and might write another book.
