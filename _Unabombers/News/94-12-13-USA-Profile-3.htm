</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> Maria Puente 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He's thought to be a quiet loner with low self-esteem, trouble dealing with 
women and maybe an obsessive-compulsive disorder.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He likes to make lists.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He also likes to make bombs.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Identity: unknown. But the FBI calls him 
&quot;<strong>Unabom.</strong>&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">So far, he's made at least 15 bombs, burned and injured 23 people and killed 
two others - the latest on Saturday, when a New Jersey advertising executive 
died after opening an explosive package received in the mail Friday.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The suspect may have a high school education. But for 16 years, he's thwarted 
the nation's savviest and most highly trained FBI agents, bomb experts and 
criminologists, who've spent millions of dollars trying to catch him.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;There have been bombers in the past, but this is extraordinary, this is extreme,&quot; says James Fox, dean of the School of Criminal Justice at Northeastern 
University in Boston and author of Overkill: Mass Murder and Serial Killing 
Exposed.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The case - dubbed 
<strong>Unabom</strong> by the FBI because of the bomber's penchant to attack people who work for 
universities and airlines - is the first of its kind of decades.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In fact, experts say, there hasn't been anything like the 
<strong>Unabom</strong> case since the 1950s, when a man named George Metesky terrorized New York City 
for seven years with homemade bombs planted at crowded locations. Fifteen 
people were 
injured.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
<strong>Unabom</strong> suspect has 
&quot;been the most wanted man in America for 10 years,&quot; says Lawrence Myers, who is writing a book on serial bombers and also is the 
author of Counterbomb: Protecting Yourself Against Car, Mail 
&amp; Area-Emplaced Bombs. 
&quot;It's the most delicious thing to him to see he's the most wanted man. . . . 
That's most important to him.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bomber's explosive creations are sophisticated - meticulously handmade, 
almost lovingly assembled killing devices.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He's 
&quot;one of the most creative and elusive bombers ever encountered,&quot; says an FBI press release.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Adds Fox: 
&quot;If he weren't good at making bombs and then covering it up, he wouldn't still 
be on the loose.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">And he may strike again. Soon.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Investigators think he may send, or already has sent, another mail bomb because 
that's his pattern.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
<strong>Unabom</strong> task force - including 35-40 agents from the FBI, the federal 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the U.S. Postal Service - has 
little to go on but a speculative 1991 psychological profile, a list of 
apparently unconnected victims and the remains of his made-from-scratch bombs 
that are virtually impossible to trace.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;He is very good at what he does, unfortunately,&quot; says New Jersey FBI agent Barry Mawn. 
&quot;And the bomb blows up a lot of evidence. We don't have a lot to go on.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI has distributed a composite sketch of a suspect, based on a witness' 
description of a man in a hooded sweatshirt and aviator glasses who was seen 
placing a wooden box in the parking lot of a Salt Lake City computer store 
bombed in 1987.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI's psychological profile suggests the person they are looking for is a 
white male in his 30s or 40s, 
probably reared in the Chicago area - where the first four bombs went off - now 
possibly living in Sacramento or San Francisco.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The profile continues: He has a history of menial jobs, and few friends. He is 
a neat dresser, meticulously organized, probably an ideal neighbor. Unlike most 
serial killers, he's not an attention-seeker.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Instead, the experts say, he enjoys the secret feelings of power when his 
devices explode, the police scurry about trying to find him and the media blare 
his exploits.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;He considers himself a real pro and that gives him a sense of pride,&quot; says Fox. 
&quot;Bombing makes him feel better about himself.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Adds Myers: 
&quot;He thinks he's so smart that he has to leave some intentional clues so they'll 
chase him some more. He sees his handiwork in print and on TV . . . (and likes) 
the mental rush of being 
hunted again because he's sent them a whole bunch of new clues.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Whoever is behind the attacks wouldn't necessarily have to be trained in 
bomb-making; a bomb can be made from easily obtainable items, such as 
fertilizer.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;It's not hard at all&quot; to build a bomb, says Paul Ragonese, former member of the New York Police bomb 
squad. 
&quot;If you read books, you could put it together.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But the devices in the 
<strong>Unabom</strong> case are unique - carefully designed to leave a 
&quot;fingerprint&quot; linking them to previous bombs.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;His signature is the careful blend of smokeless black powder he uses,&quot; says Myers. 
&quot;He also makes his own wooden boxes . . . handcrafted almost like he has 
cabinetmaking skills. He spends an incredible amount of time on detail. He also 
polishes all of his metals, sands them.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Also, the bombs usually contain a part bearing the letters 
&quot;FC.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In 
a letter to The New York Times last year, believed to be from the bomber, the 
writer identified 
&quot;FC&quot; as an anarchist group. Investigators say 
&quot;FC&quot; may stand for an obscene phrase denigrating computers.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">That raises a possible motive: the suspect as a modern-day Luddite raging 
against technology. All the victims were connected to either the airline 
industry, computer industry or university departments in computers, genetics 
and technology.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The latest victim, Thomas Mosser, 50, an executive with the advertising firm 
Young 
&amp; Rubicam, had numerous contacts with the airline industry, and his firm had 
just been hired by two major computer companies.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mosser also had just been featured in a New York Times article about his recent 
promotion. Three of the other victims had been featured in Times articles as 
well.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But Fox questions the notion that the suspect has 
a technology grudge.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I think he's simply striking back at successful people,&quot; Fox says. 
&quot;They have something he does not have - professional success.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The randomness of the bombings terrifies many, as does the possibility the 
suspect won't be caught. Myers estimates that authorities catch only 1 out of 
every 3 bombers.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;They'll never catch him,&quot; predicts Myers. 
&quot;What will catch him is old age . . . or incarceration for another reason. The 
only thing we can do is react to him.&quot;

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Warning signs The Postal Service says it's impossible to screen billions of 
pieces of mail for bombs. Experts say mail bombs frequently have similarities:
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Explosive chemicals often leave stains
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Package is lopsided, with soft spots or bulges, or envelope is rigid or bulky
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Excessive postage; bombers typically avoid going into post offices
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Erratic writing on the address label, with 
no return address
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Key clues to 'Unabomb'
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> -- Most bombs had components, designed to 
survive the blasts, stamped with 'FC'
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> -- Investigators believe 'FC' represents an 
obscene phrase denigrating computers. Most targets appear involved in technology
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> -- The bombs have been constructed with 
hard-to-trace household items: nails, screws, towels, fishing line, glue, 
string, handmade switches, a barometer, metal, pipes, gunpowder and batteries
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Where the bomber struck Since 1978 there have been 15 bombings in 12 cities 
that are linked in a case code-named '<strong>Unabom'</strong> because early bombings targeted universities and airlines.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Evanston, Ill. (2) Washington, D.C. (1) Berkeley, Calif. (2) North Caldwell, 
N.J. (1) Auburn, Wash. (1) Ann Arbor, Mich. (1) Sacramento, Calif. (1) Salt 
Lake City (2) San Francisco (1) New Haven, Conn. (1) Chicago (1) Nashville (1)
