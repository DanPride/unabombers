<strong>Unabomber</strong> letters 



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> By Richard Saltus, Globe Staff 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">When he targeted two prominent and well-liked Massachusetts scientists with 
warning letters, the mysterious letter-bomb maker known as 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> sent a shiver of fear through the Boston area's large scientific and technical 
community.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">After the existence of the letters was disclosed yesterday, many researchers 
refused to discuss the potential danger publicly for fear of attracting the 
attention of the bomber or imitators.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I'm very upset about what's going on and I actually feel quite vulnerable,&quot; said a Boston-area genetic scientist.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I have thought a lot about being in the position I am in, given that someone 
feels this way about geneticists and biologists,&quot; added the scientist, who requested anonymity because 
&quot;who knows who reads what.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> sent letters to Nobel laureates Phillip A. Sharp of the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology and Richard J. Roberts of New England Biolabs Inc. in 
Beverly.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Although the prevailing response was a nervous silence, one biotech official 
unleashed a torrent of indignation at the campaign against what the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> has called 
&quot;techno-nerds&quot; who are 
&quot;changing the world.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I find it disgusting that there are such people in the world,&quot; said Alison Taunton-Rigby, president of the Massachusetts Biotechnology 
Council Inc. in Worcester.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Phil Sharp is someone I really admire; he's a forerunner&quot; in the DNA research that underlies the development of the 
biotechnology industry, she said, 
&quot;and it appalls me that someone would do something like this.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;We're realizing that we're more of a target as an area of research,&quot; she said from the council's Worcester headquarters.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> who got his nickname because his first bombs went to university scientists and 
airline executives, sent the letters to Sharp and Roberts on April 20, the same 
day a package bomb he mailed killed a timber industry lobbyist in Sacramento, 
Calif.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Taunton-Rigby and officials of other research institutions said security 
measures were tightened two years ago after the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> mailed a letter bomb that seriously injured a Yale computer scientist when he 
opened the package.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">After that attack, MIT police circulated a set of guidelines about suspicious 
mail, said spokesman Ken Campbell. The institute sent out another advisory 
on April 26 after the New York Times printed a lengthy letter from the bomber 
in which he railed against computer scientists and geneticists.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Campbell said Sharp and MIT officials would have no comment on the latest 
events. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">David Baltimore, also a Nobel laureate at MIT, declined comment on the bomber's 
latest communications. But he said he felt that criticism of biological 
research and biotechnology had diminished in recent years.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Baltimore noted that some individuals in the Pacific Northwest are espousing a 
life that is as free as possible of technological trappings.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;In the diverse world we live in, there's room for an anti-technology movement 
in its benign form,&quot; but not when it expresses itself in violence, he said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">At the Harvard School of Public Health, Max Essex, an AIDS researcher, said he 
hadn't 
heard of any changes in security as a result of the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> new letters.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Although the bomber struck in New England before, injuring the Yale scientist 
two years ago, 
&quot;I haven't thought about it personally very much,&quot; said Essex.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He said it did catch his attention when Sharp and Roberts were singled out. 
&quot;I realized, 'Gee, I know these people,' 
&quot; he said.

 Letter and package bomb indicators

slim, the Postal Service offers the following signs to help you recognize a 
suspicious mailing that could be a letter or package bomb:
