</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the federal files on 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> - the code name for the meticulous serial bomber officially linked to two mail 
explosions that injured university professors last week - there is the curious 
entry of Ice Brothers, a book sent to the home of then-United Airlines 
President Percy Wood on June 10, 1980. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A little-known work on efforts of the Allied underground to disrupt German 
U-boats during World War II, the 517-page book by Sloan Wilson was delivered a 
week after an anonymous letter announced that it would arrive. As he opened the 
book in the kitchen of his Lake Forest home, there was a powerful explosion 
that left Wood severely battered and burned.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">It was the third of 14 blasts that have killed one person and injured 23. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Could the topic of the book help investigators identify the suspect behind 
bombings from 1978 until as recently as Thursday? Or was it another false lead 
left by 
<strong>UNABOM,</strong> who has no apparent motive and has left no trace of his whereabouts in 15 
years? Investigators said they haven't a clue. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;It's crazy,&quot; said Jim Cavanaugh, deputy chief of the firearms and explosives division at 
the Bureau of Alchohol, Tobacco and Firearms. 
&quot;There are more theories on this guy's motives than there are for JFK's 
assassination. In fact, we should probably start with Jack Ruby as a suspect.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Cavanaugh's comments reflect the frustration of U.S. officials at the 
re-emergence of the elusive bomber, who, until last Tuesday, had appeared to 
have halted the bombings in 1987. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the latest attacks, 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> is believed to have 
targeted two university scientists widely considered to be among the elite in 
their fields: David Gelernter, 38, a Yale computer scientist, and Charles 
Epstein, 59, a geneticist at the University of California at San Francisco. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Gelernter was listed in guarded condition following a mail bomb explosion in 
his office Thursday that severely wounded him in the abdomen, chest, face and 
hands. On Tuesday, Epstein lost several fingers and sustained a broken arm and 
severe abdominal wounds when a package bomb exploded in his Tiburon, Calif., 
home. He was listed in fair condition. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Last week's bombings were not the first time 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> has reappeared after a hiatus, officials said. Three years separated two 
bombings at the engineering building of the University of California at 
Berkeley: the first was July 
2, 1982; the second May 15, 1985. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Federal officials coined the code name 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> after the 1980 bombing of Wood, according to Rick Smith, spokesman for the FBI 
in San Francisco. Short for United Airlines bomber, the moniker also alludes to 
the suspect's penchant for targeting academics. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Forensics experts believe . . . that the maker or makers of each of these 14 
explosive devices are the same person or persons,&quot; Milt Ahlerich, who heads the FBI in Connecticut, told reporters Friday in New 
Haven. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The relatively new possibility of multiple 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> suspects came from a letter to the New York Times postmarked from Sacramento 
June 21, the day before the Epstein bombing. Friday, the newspaper reported 
that the letter warned of an upcoming 
&quot;newsworthy event&quot; and identified the writer or writers as 
&quot;an anarchist group calling ourselves FC.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Cavanaugh said 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> has been identified as 
&quot;FC&quot; in letters to two earlier victims. But he cautioned that it could be a ruse.
