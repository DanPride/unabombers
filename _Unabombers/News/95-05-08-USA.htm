Information widespread on building incendiary devices 



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> DEBORAH TEDFORD, RAD SALLEE; Staff 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong></p><p class="body" align="Left">From 1992 to 1993, the number of Americans killed or injured
by explosives or incendiary devices nearly tripled and property
damage shot up more than 20-fold.  Most of this tragedy arose from a
single incident, the World Trade Center bombing.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 1994 numbers, still being compiled by the U.S. Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, will probably be lower.  But the toll
will shoot up again for 1995, when the deaths, maimings and
destruction of the April 19 Oklahoma City blast are tallied, said
local ATF spokeswoman Franceska Perot.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">That bombing, the worst domestic terrorism incident on record
in the United States, has caused 164 confirmed deaths.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Donnie Carter, special-agent-in-charge of ATF's Houston field
office, said more and more people are experimenting with explosives.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;&quot;You just go to your library and you can get books on
building bombs,'' he said.  
&quot;&quot;If you can read, you can find out how
to do it. ''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">More information is available on the Internet and through
computer bulletin boards, Perot noted.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In 1993, according to ATF statistics, 70 people lost their
lives and 1,375 were injured in explosive and incendiary incidents,
the vast majority of them intentional.  Damage was estimated at
$ 526.4 million.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 1992 toll had been much lower: 45 deaths, 469 injuries
and $ 22.6 million in losses.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bombing on Feb. 26, 1993, of the twin 
110-story New York
office towers injured more than 1,000 people, killed six, and
caused damage estimated at more than $ 500 million.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Largely because of that one bombing, only 5 percent of the
1993 casualties (deaths and injuries) were classified as
accidental.  In 1992, 27 percent had been accidental, many of them
occurring at fireworks factories.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Accidents made up just 75 of the 9,500 incidents investigated
by ATF agents during the five years 1989-93.  The sum includes bomb
threats and hoaxes, as well as thefts and recoveries of explosives.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">About 40 percent of the incidents were classified as criminal
bombings and another 8 percent as attempted bombings, in which the
device malfunctioned or was deactivated before it could go off.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Among the victims was an ATF agent, Johnny Masengale, who was
killed in the Seattle area May 6, 
1992, while disposing of
explosives held as evidence.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;&quot;In a lot of cases,'' said Perot, 
&quot;&quot;the individual building
the bomb injures himself because he doesn't know what he's doing. ''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Igor Longo, 22, an Italian studying engineering at the
University of Houston, was charged with possession of an
unregistered destructive device and other federal offenses after a
pipe bomb went off in a trash receptacle Feb. 12.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Longo lost an arm and suffered facial injuries in the blast,
which occurred at a bus stop near West Dallas and Taft in the
Montrose area.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">More often, the victims were simply in the wrong place at the
wrong time, like many of those inside the A.P. Murrah Federal
Building in Oklahoma City when a truck loaded with explosive
fertilizer and fuel oil was parked 
outside and detonated.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Houston mail carrier Nathan Cook, 70, who had taken the route
to keep busy after a career in petroleum geology, was injured Oct.
19, 1993 when a package exploded as he was taking it out of a
mailbox.  Another bomb was found inside the box.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">ATF statistics on more than 11,000 U.S. bombing incidents
investigated from 1989-1993 show most of the devices were left in
mailboxes, followed closely by residences.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bureau has jurisdiction to investigate crimes involving
explosives, except for those involving terrorism or federal
property, where the FBI is in charge.  Even then, ATF agents are
included as part of a National Response Team.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">State or local officers are typically first to arrive after a
bombing.  They secure the site and call ATF, whose agents clear the
area and meticulously collect fragments of 
debris.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">With skill and luck, agents can deduce the type and location
of the bomb, and possibly the bomber's identity.  In both the World
Trade Center and Oklahoma City bombings, identifiable parts of the
trucks used were found and traced.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
&quot;&quot;why'' and 
&quot;&quot;how'' of a bombing or incendiary incident
are often easy to answer.  Of 6,574 cases investigated by ATF from
1988-1993, nearly 90 percent were motivated by vandalism or revenge.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Other motives -- including political protests, extortion,
insurance fraud, labor disputes, homicide and suicide -- together
accounted for only about one incident out of 10.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">About 5 percent of the incidents happened in Texas, which has
7 percent of the nation's population.  The state, second only to
California in population, ranked fourth in explosives incidents,
with 1,052 compared to California's 3,171.  Illinois and Florida
were second and third.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Comparable 
figures for Harris County or Houston were not
available.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The devices most often used nationally were pipe bombs and
bottles filled with gasoline -- so-called 
&quot;&quot;Molotov cocktails,''
the Russian revolutionists' simple but effective anti-tank weapon.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">More sophisticated villains may booby-trap something as
innocuous as an envelope or package.  For instance, federal
authorities have been stymied since 1978 by the mysterious
&quot;&quot;<strong>Unabomber,</strong>'' whose mail bombs have killed two people and injured
23.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A $ 1 million reward is offered for information leading to the
arrest and conviction of 
&quot;&quot;<strong>Unabomber,</strong>'' who for a time targeted
universities and airlines.  In December, a New Jersey advertising
executive was killed by one of the bombs.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">FBI and ATF agents in Houston are assigned to a nationwide
task force aimed at catching the mailbomber.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Deaths, damage from explosives.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The number of deaths and injuries resulting from explosives
in the United States nearly tripled from 1992 to 1993 - when 70
people lost their lives and 1,375 were injured by blasts.
