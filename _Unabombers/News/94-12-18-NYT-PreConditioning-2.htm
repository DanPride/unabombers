</p><p class="body" align="Left">The package bomb that killed Thomas J. Mosser last weekend was crafted by hand 
from metal, wood, explosives and a few other easily obtainable materials, but 
it was not crude. Its trigger was so expertly made that it withstood the 
jostling of a cross-country trip through the Christmas mails without exploding. 
It arrived at the Mosser home in North Caldwell, N.J., looking harmless.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> When it did detonate, Mr. Mosser, 50, a prominent advertising executive, 
became the latest victim of a mysterious serial bomber who has made 14 other 
attacks since 1978, killing one other person and wounding 22 in a case hundreds 
of Federal agents have vainly tried to solve. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The F.B.I. believes that the suspect is a middle-aged recluse with anarchist 
leanings who may be operating from northern California, but even that is 
uncertain. The bomber seems to harbor a hatred for the growing influence of 
technology in society. But why that led him to go after Mr. Mosser is unclear. 
Perhaps it was because Mr. Mosser's firm, Young 
&amp; Rubicam, has handled technology clients.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> With so few leads and fears that the bomber may strike again, Federal agencies 
appear to be changing strategy in the case, which has been called 
<strong>Unabom</strong> because the suspect's early targets were universities and airlines. They are 
now appealing to the public and publicizing a sketch of the suspect.CLIFFORD J. LEVY
