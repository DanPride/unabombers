</p><p class="body" align="Left">A mail bomb severely wounded a Yale University computer scientist Thursday, and 
the FBI was investigating a possible link to other explosions, including one 
that injured a California professor earlier this week. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">David Gelernter, 38, was opening his mail in his office at 8:15 a.m. when the 
explosion occurred, said John Sennett, an FBI spokesman. Later, after the 
bombing was reported on radio, someone called in a threat to the medical center 
where Gelernter's brother, a Yale geneticist, works.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bombing occurred two days after a geneticist at the University of 
California-San Francisco, Charles Epstein, lost several fingers when a mail 
bomb exploded at his home. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI was looking for possible connections between the two cases and other 
recent bombings, both solved and unsolved, Sennett said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Officials said the bombings bore the hallmark of the elusive 
&quot;<strong>UNABOM,</strong>&quot; who targeted employees of the computer industry and university researchers for 
more than a decade before the bombings stopped in 1987. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The previous bombings killed one person and injured 21. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI said authorities had to presume that David Gelernter was an intended 
target of Thursday's attack, although no reason was apparent why he would be 
singled out. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Gelernter, an associate professor and director of undergraduate studies in 
computer science, was the creator of a computer language that 
allows desktop computers to achieve the power of supercomputers. A colleague 
described him as an outspoken conservative. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Dr. Joel Gelernter, a Yale psychiatrist whose field of speciality is genetics, 
works at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in nearby West Haven. He is 
investigating whether there is a genetic component to alcoholism. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">After the bombing, someone called the medical center switchboard and warned: 
&quot; 'You are next,' 
&quot; said Louise FitzSimons, a VA spokeswoman. Agents checked Joel Gelernter's 
mail, but the hospital wasn't evacuated. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Authorities said they did not immediately know the type of parcel or explosive 
that was used in the bomb. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The blast severely wounded David Gelernter's abdomen, chest, face and hands. 
His condition was upgraded from critical to serious Thursday afternoon. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">This week's other victim, Epstein, 59, was listed in fair condition at Marin 
General Hospital. The head of the 
medical genetics division at UC-San Francisco lost several fingers on his right 
hand and suffered burns, cuts and other injuries to his chest, abdomen and face 
when he opened a package bomb in his kitchen. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Epstein is known for his work locating a gene that may contribute to Down 
syndrome.
