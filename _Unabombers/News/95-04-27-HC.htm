<strong>Unabomber's</strong> letter slams college grads and 
&quot;techno-nerds' 



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> HOWARD KURTZ, JOHN SCHWARTZ; Washington Post 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The serial bomber in the 
&quot;&quot;Unabom'' case appears to be
motivated by a deep resentment of college graduates, scientists and
advances in computer research, according to a letter made public
Wednesday.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">FBI officials in San Francisco released a letter, which they
believe is from the bomber, that was sent last week to David
Gelernter, a Yale University computer scientist who was injured
seriously by a package bomb in June 1993.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;&quot;People with advanced degrees aren't as smart as they think
they are,'' the letter said.  
&quot;&quot;If you'd had any brains you would
have realized that there are a lot of people out there who resent
bitterly the way techno-nerds like you are changing the world and
you wouldn't have been dumb enough to open an unexpected package
from an unknown source. ''
 The purported bomber, who has struck 16 times since 1978 and
killed three people, 
continued: 
&quot;&quot;In the epilog of your book,
&quot;&quot;Mirror Worlds,'' you tried to justify your research by claiming
that the developments you describe are inevitable, and that any
college person can learn enough about computers to compete in a
computer-dominated world.  Apparently, people without a college
degree don't count.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;&quot;In any case, being informed about computers won't enable
anyone to prevent invasion of privacy (through computers), genetic
engineering (to which computers make an important contribution),
environmental degradation through excessive economic growth
(computers make an important contribution to economic growth) and
so forth. . . .
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;&quot;If the developments you describe are inevitable, they are
not inevitable in the way that old age or bad weather are
inevitable.  They are inevitable only because techno-nerds like you
make them inevitable.  If there were no computer scientists there
would be no progress in computer science. . . .  But we do not
believe that progress and growth are inevitable. ''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Jim Freeman, head of the FBI's San Francisco office, told
reporters: 
&quot;&quot;This is the first time in 17 years we've had any
degree of discussion by the 
<strong>Unabomber.</strong> ''
 He said the letter to Gelernter makes clear that his
motivation is 
&quot;&quot;because the doctor is a computer scientist'' and
the 
bomber 
&quot;&quot;vehemently objects'' to the direction of Gelernter's
research.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Freeman said the FBI, which believes the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> is a
white male in his early 40s, has no evidence the killer is working
with others.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Gelernter said Wednesday that the FBI had asked him not to
comment on the letter.  He said that his book 
&quot;&quot;Mirror Worlds'' sold
fewer than 20,000 copies.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The letter to Gelernter is one of four, all postmarked
Oakland, Calif., sent by the self-described 
&quot;&quot;anarchist'' last week.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Two other letters went to individuals who have not been
victims and whose names were not made public.  The fourth was sent
to The New York Times, which published it Wednesday.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In that letter, which also indicated a desire to publicize
his grievances, the writer demanded that a national newspaper or
magazine publish a lengthy manuscript.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The purported terrorist told the newspaper that 
&quot;&quot;we will
permanently desist from terrorist activities'' if 
a manuscript of
29,000 to 37,000 words 
&quot;&quot;is published in The New York Times, Time
or Newsweek, or in some other widely read, nationally distributed
periodical. . . .  Alternatively, it can be published as a small
book. . . .  If the answer is unsatisfactory, we will start building
our next bomb. ''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The writer said 
&quot;&quot;the article will not explicitly advocate
violence.  There will be an unavoidable implication that we favor
violence to the extent that it may be necessary . . . '' The Times
received the letter Monday, shortly before a package-bomb killed
Gilbert Murray, a timber industry official in Sacramento, Calif.  It
was postmarked Thursday, the day after the explosion in Oklahoma
City.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Officials speculated the bomber was seeking attention in the
wake of the Oklahoma City tragedy.
