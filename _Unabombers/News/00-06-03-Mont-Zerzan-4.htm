</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong> 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A Web site used to marshal the forces of mayhem for this weekend's meeting of 
the Organization of American States reveals both the threat and the limits of 
the new anarchism. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Infoshop News Kiosk - ''anarchist, activist and alternative news'' - 
includes a call to shut down the Windsor meeting where foreign ministers will 
discuss a continent-wide free-trade agreement. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''The experiences gained in Seattle and Washington will help our struggle 
against global capitalism remain autonomous, democratic and effective,'' the 
missive on www.infoshop.org begins. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''However, experience has also shown that our effectiveness is only limited to 
the organizational cohesion of affinity (protest) groups. We cannot stress the 
importance of meeting regularly with your affinity groups frequently before you 
come to Windsor.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Organizers ask the groups to answer a few essential questions online: How many 
are you? What level of risk/confrontation does your affinity group represent? 
How many arrestibles are in your group? Is there anything other affinity groups 
should know about your group or your intentions? 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">On the March 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">They conclude with an apology for such an unseemly imposition of order: ''We 
realize this sounds like a very centralized process, but we're trying to 
facilitate autonomous co-ordination, and are always open to any suggestions.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Once assigned to the quiet shelves of history, anarchists are back on the march 
and in the news. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Their long dormant philosophy - and its emphasis on empowering the individual - 
has breathed intellectual energy and destructive force into protest movements 
worldwide. Curiously, it is anarchism that has provided the glue between fringe 
elements of the environmental, anti-trade, animal-rights, 
labour and anti-poverty movements. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Although they might be difficult to organize and direct, these are anarchists 
with a cause. The disruptive power of the free-form radicals was on display at 
the World Trade Organization's gathering in Seattle and, to a lesser degree, at 
the April meeting of the International Monetary Fund in Washington. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Starting tomorrow, Windsor will confront the same spirited and fleet-footed 
opponents of corporate power and state authority. Calgary, host of this year's 
World Petroleum Congress, faces them next week. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">As the radicals ready themselves, police officials and politicians are trying 
to assess the threat they pose and agree on appropriate counter-measures. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Jaggi Singh and Genny Santos canvassed door-to-door in downtown Windsor this 
week, just days before the mayhem is scheduled to begin. Self-described 
anarchists, they were trying to spread their anti-corporate message 
among the city's working class and win recruits to their cause. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">It was tough going, though; the reputation of these radicals preceded them. The 
rampage in Seattle cost businesses there $<strong></strong>17 million U.S. The people of Windsor are on edge. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The city has barricaded a downtown city block with chainlink fences anchored in 
concrete, businesses have boarded up their windows, and about 2,000 police 
officers - including Toronto's mounted crowd-control unit - are preparing for 
the worst. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Singh, 27, and Santos, 22, organizers with the OAS Shutdown Coalition, say 
their presence here is misunderstood. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''Windsor is a working-class town. We're not targeting the city; we're 
targeting the OAS,'' said Singh who played a key role in the 1997 APEC summit 
protests in Vancouver. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''This idea that we'd come to trash the city is just horrible,'' he said. ''I 
don't think you'll see any of that.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Yet when pressed, Singh said he couldn't say for sure what will happen since 
the coalition's primary job is to attract so-called affinity groups to Windsor. 
The groups - like-minded people committed to the same brand of disorder - are 
expected to decide for themselves what they'll do during the protest. Some will 
perform street theatre, others are expected to scale buildings. Still others 
might heave rocks through windows. It's all part of what the new radicals call 
''direct action.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''People are tired of having rallies where they walk around in circles and 
don't have any kind of impact,'' said Santos, a University of Toronto 
political-science graduate. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Direct action, she said, affords individuals the chance to alter the workings 
of unelected and hugely powerful organizations, like the WTO, the World Bank 
and the OAS. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''They're the problem,'' Singh said, ''and we're going to confront it directly.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In keeping with the anarchist model of organization - and yes, Singh insisted, 
there is such a beast - there's no leader. Each group acts for itself, but is 
supposed to send an emissary - or ''spoke'' - to the planning council, which 
passes on information about potential strategies. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">One pamphlet, for instance, notes that Casino Windsor lies outside the 
no-protest area being established by the police: ''A huge, cash-sucking casino 
is located in this area ... and we hope to bring the spirit of anti-capitalism 
and anti-greed to this charming locale. Puppeteers, clowns, dancers, radical 
cheerleaders, freaks, musicians and guerrilla gardeners should plan to revel in 
this neighbourhood.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The anarchist structure makes it easy for radicals of all stripes to feel 
comfortable in the same formless 
tent. But it means the messages that emanate from protests like this are often 
lost on observers who understandably view them as anti-everything. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''There's this idea that we're professional protesters, and you can use that 
term if you want, but it comes from a political perspective: the idea that this 
is a bigger struggle,'' Singh said. ''If it's a blockade to save forests, if 
it's standing up for low- income housing, or fighting against police brutality 
or brutality in prisons, they're all part of the capitalist system.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In many ways, the message is the mayhem. It's meant to remind everyone that the 
authorities are not in control. And indeed, the organizational structure 
reflects that goal since neither Singh nor anyone else is sure what's going to 
happen. No one knows when the first bottle will be thrown or how to stop the 
violence should it escalate. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''We can't 
predict what anyone is going to do, but you should also ask that of the 
police,'' Singh said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In Washington, Seattle, and at the APEC summit in Vancouver, it was the police 
that unleashed the violence, he said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">But the police must protect property against anarchists, many of whom do not 
regard property damage as violence. It makes clashes inevitable. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''If you had property downtown and someone was destroying it, you'd expect us 
to do something,'' said Windsor police Staff Sergeant Dave Rossell. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">For their part, protest organizers are also prepared. Affinity groups have been 
warned to come equipped with mineral water and alcohol swabs to defend against 
pepper spray. Legal and medical teams have been assembled. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''We're not giving anybody any orders,'' Singh said in rejecting a suggestion 
that anarchist organizers are, in effect, the puppetmasters of disaster. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''We're giving people all the power and tools they 
need to be effective. That's not a form of control, that's a form of 
empowerment.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Born and raised in Toronto, Singh attended the city's venerable St. Michael's 
High School where he had his first taste of activism, taking part in 
anti-apartheid and environmental protests. ''I came to see that there was a lot 
wrong with the world, but the kind of activism I was involved with was the 
feel-good activism.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">It wasn't until university - he studied philosophy, history and linguistics at 
the Universities of Toronto and British Columbia - that he came to believe more 
radical action was necessary. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Influenced by social critics like Noam Chomsky, Singh decided that rather than 
''trying to smooth the edges of a bad world, we should try to change it 
altogether.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The growing anarchist movement caught his attention. And its focus on the 
destruction of capitalism appealed to his own sensibilities about what was 
fundamentally wrong with 
society. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">He didn't like rampant materialism; he objected to the exploitation of nature 
for commercial gain. Anarchism's values of voluntary association, mutual aid, 
and autonomous, self-governing communities struck a chord. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">At UBC, Singh helped organize the APEC demonstrations and gained national 
notoriety when he was arrested in advance of the protest on flimsy charges that 
were eventually dropped. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''When you start to challenge authority, then you're a radical,'' he said. 
''I'm not ashamed to say I'm anarchist.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Like any of today's committed anarchists, Singh wants to tear down the 
instruments of globalization - APEC, OAS, WTO, IMF - organizations that extend 
the reach and power of capitalism. He insists he's not against global trade 
that promises to improve the lot of workers in poor countries, but he is 
against a system that places corporations and their interests ahead of human 
rights and the environment. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''They've 
taken trade and made it an idol. To oppose it means you're nuts, like you're 
opposed to gravity.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Singh doesn't look radical; there are no pins or tattooes. Thin, bookish, and 
well spoken, he wears a gray Nehru jacket over a black T-shirt. It's easy to 
picture him as a lawyer, and yet, as he says: ''I'm the antithesis of what a 
St. Mike's graduate is supposed to be.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">His mother, a nurse, and his father, a cab driver, came to Canada from India 
before he was born. His mother is quietly supportive of his activism, but would 
prefer it if he pursued his PhD or law degree. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''She obviously would prefer that I settled down,'' said Singh, who makes ends 
meet by writing for Montreal's alternative press, including This Magazine. 
''But she sees that I'm satisfied with what I'm doing. And for now, she 
says she just wants to make sure if my photo is taken that I'm clean shaven.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">- - - 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">For much of the past 60 years, the currents of anarchism crackled softly in the 
relative obscurity of coffee houses and university campuses. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">That changed suddenly in May 1995 when the New York Times and Washington Post 
published the 35,000-word political manifesto of a mysterious domestic 
terrorist known only as the 
<strong>Unabomber.</strong> Its publication would lead to the arrest of mathematics professor Ted 
Kaczynski - his brother recognized the tract and informed the FBI - and provide 
inspiration to radical anarchists worldwide. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Kaczynski crystallized the radical case against technology - he said it 
exacerbates the corporate control of people's lives and speeds the destruction 
of nature - and offered a defence of violence as the only means to alter 
society's path. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The manifesto won the admiration of John Zerzan, an Oregon-based writer, whose 
prison visits with Kaczynski affirmed the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> status as an anarchist icon. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Zerzan, 56, is considered one of the most influential of today's anarchist 
thinkers. A political-science graduate from Stanford University who also holds 
a master's degree in history, Zerzan has produced an influential series of 
essays in which he denounces consumerism and technology as contemporary forms 
of slavery. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Unlike the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> though, Zerzan equivocates about the use of violence to bring about a kinder, 
simpler society based on the classic anarchist model: small, independent 
communities that operate without elected leaders. That view puts Zerzan in what 
might be called the mainstream of radical anarchism. Old school anarchists 
maintain that the movement must be based on an ethical, non-violent approach 
lest one form of oppression replaces another. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">More radical 
factions believe that words and peaceful protests have accomplished nothing in 
recent years. They believe it's necessary to inflict damage on the corporations 
that extend the reach of global trade and technology at the expense of the 
Earth and its poorest citizens. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The idea has its roots in the radical environmental movement. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In 1980, the Earth First! group took as its motto: ''No compromise in defence 
of Mother Earth.'' Its founder, Dave Foreman, produced a how-to book, A Field 
Guide to Monkeywrenching, that set the stage for years of confrontation between 
resource companies and the uncompromising activists who would sabotage their 
machinery, spike trees or block roads in defence of forests. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Portland Oregonian last year identified 100 significant acts of destruction 
on the West Coast since 1980 linked to ecoterrorists, or radical animal-rights 
groups, like the Animal Liberation 
Front. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Although not always identified with anarchists, the radicals operate on 
anarchist principles that encourage autonomous local groups to take the direct 
action that suits them. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The philosophy has given rise to a loose and leaderless resistance movement 
that has played a role in riots on the streets of London, a nine-month student 
strike in Mexico City and thousands of tree-sits across the Pacific Northwest. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A century ago, the individual acts of anarchists caused serious political 
havoc: anarchist assassins claimed as their victims President Sadi Carnot of 
France (1894), Empress Elizabeth of Austria (1898), King Umberto of Italy 
(1900), President William McKinley of the United States (1901). 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">But today, the new anarchists are using numbers to wage mayhem. In Windsor, as 
the city awaits the OAS shutdown attempt, the police are still guessing 
at those numbers. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''We don't know if it's going to be 2,000 or 20, 000,'' said Sgt. Rossell. 
''And from what I can tell, I don't think the protest organizers know either.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">- - - 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Singh said he doesn't consider it a violent act to heave a rock through the 
window of a Gap Store or a Wal-Mart since it doesn't harm other people. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''The prospect of violence from us, no matter how you define it, is so minimal 
and marginal compared to the violence perpetrated in the name of global free 
trade,'' he said. ''Poverty is a form of violence, prisons are violence. 
Putting some graffiti on McDonald's is farcical by comparison.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Although he doesn't embrace Kaczynski's extremism, Singh said he believes the 
trashing of Seattle stores during the WTO protest was an effective form of 
direct action. ''There's this boredom 
out there which even the people in the suburbs can relate to: the feeling that 
there must be something more to life than buying into mutual funds.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">For Singh, life is now about organizing anarchists and other radicals who share 
his views on the evils of big business and big trade deals. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">He rattled off a series of upcoming international meetings: the World Petroleum 
Congress in Calgary, the International Monetary Fund in Prague; the Asian 
Development Bank in Thailand. Each of the big meetings - they're like the 
Olympics for protesters, Singh said - will draw radicals intent on disrupting 
their business. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Windsor is expected to be a small event by comparison. Singh called it a 
warm-up for a meeting next April in Quebec City known as the Summit of the 
Americas, in which 34 leaders 
will discuss the proposed continental free trade deal. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">He warned that the chaos games in Quebec City will be ''huge.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''It's going to be like Seattle and Washington. They're just crazy to try to 
hold it in Quebec City. It's a challenge to us, a slap in the face. Why would 
they hold it in that city when they know we're going to mobilize thousands to 
shut it down? 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''It's crazy.''
