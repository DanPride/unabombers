</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> By Michael Rezendes, Globe Staff 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Who is 
<strong>Unabom?</strong> The question has bedeviled federal investigators for 15 years as they have 
struggled to identify the maker of 12 package bombs aimed at a disparate group 
of university professors, computer dealers and people who work for airlines and 
aircraft companies.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Now, after two additional explosions last week, authorities may also start 
asking, 
&quot;What is 
<strong>Unabom,</strong>&quot; as they analyze a letter mailed to The New York Times that appeared to 
identify the party responsible for the bombings as 
&quot;an anarchist group&quot; calling itself 
&quot;FC.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">According to investigators working a case as mysterious as it is murderous, 
<strong>Unabom</strong> has frustrated the best efforts of law enforcement in part because of the wide 
array of victims, and in part because of the unpredictability of the attacks.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Federal authorities named their quarry 
<strong>Unabom</strong> in the early stages of their investigation after concluding that they were 
searching for a bomber 
who targeted universities, airlines and aircraft companies.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Even though many of the university victims appear to have an expertise in 
technical sciences, investigators have never been able to figure out why 
<strong>Unabom</strong> has tried to kill them.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Nailing down the motive has been one of the most difficult aspects of the case,&quot; said Milt Ahlerich, the special agent in charge of the FBI in Connecticut.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">For investigators, the latest explosions came as an unwelcome reminder of 
unfinished business that once had consumed the attention of a task force of 
federal and local police searching for a suspect seen placing a bomb in the 
parking lot of a Salt Lake City computer dealership.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A witness to the 1987 episode, in which a computer company employee was 
disabled, described a white male with sun glasses and a thin mustache, and 
enabled police to develop a sketch that was featured in a 
wanted poster offering $ 50,000 for information leading to the suspect's arrest.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Shortly thereafter, investigators also developed a psychological profile of a 
suspect believed to be an obsessive personality, who is fastidious in his 
personal habits, keeps meticulous lists and rarely draws attention to himself.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The profile also said that the suspect is probably a loner who finds it 
difficult to make friends and is likely to have a younger girlfriend, if he has 
one at all.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The first bomb linked to the case exploded in May 1978, on the Northwestern 
University campus in Evanston, Ill., injuring a campus police officer called to 
inspect a suspicious package.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Over the next four years, four more bombs were detonated on campuses in 
Evanston, Salt Lake City, Nashville and Berkeley, Calif.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Over the same period of time, 
two additional bombs exploded, one in the mailbag aboard an American Airlines 
flight en route from Chicago to Washington, and another in the Lake Forest, 
Ill., home of the president of United Airlines.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">According to a 1989 article in Reader's Digest cited last week by federal 
authorities, FBI investigators were able to link the 12 episodes through 
analyses of the bombs, not all of which exploded, and evidence at bombing sites.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bomber, the article said, became recognizable to investigators through 
painstaking construction techniques and the inclusion of wood fragments and 
pieces of polished metal that amounted to a 
&quot;signature.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">When a suspect was seen placing the bomb that went off in the parking lot of 
the Salt Lake City computer sales firm, the episode was regarded as a crucial 
break because it followed the busiest and deadliest year in the 
<strong>Unabom</strong> case.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In 1985, 
<strong>Unabom</strong> struck four times, at the University of California at Berkeley, at the 
University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, at a Boeing manufacturing plant in Auburn, 
Wash., and at a computer rental store in Sacramento, Calif., where the store 
owner was killed.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But just as investigators developed their personality profile and distributed 
copies of the sketch of a suspect, 
<strong>Unabom</strong> fell quiet until last week.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">On Tuesday, Charles Epstein, a 59-year-old geneticist at the University of 
California at San Francisco, lost several fingers when a mail bomb exploded in 
his hands as he opened a padded manila envelope in the kitchen of his Tiburon 
home.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Two days later, David Gelernter, a 38-year-old computer scientist at 
Yale, was seriously injured while opening the morning mail in his office at a 
campus computer center.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Investigators do not know why 
<strong>Unabom</strong> struck again. But the explosions, and the fact that Gelernter was the first 
East Coast victim in the case, set off a wave of precautionary measures at 
universities.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">At Harvard, for example, university police blanketed the campus with printed 
warnings and cautionary messages delivered by hand, fax machine, and telephonic 
voice mail to offices, dormitories, and other university-owned housing.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;We want to make sure that everyone who receives mail through the Postal Service 
knows how to recognize a strange package,&quot; said Lt. Larry Murphy.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">At Brandeis, university spokesman Dennis Nealon said that 1,200 letters were 
sent to faculty and staff members with instructions on how to 
recognize suspicious mailings.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">And at Northeastern University, public safety director D. Joseph Griffin was 
issuing written alerts to 55 department heads.
