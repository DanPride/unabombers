<strong>UNABOMBER</strong> 



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> By JENIFER WARREN and DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>DATELINE:</strong> SACRAMENTO 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Is he a tree-hugger or laid-off airline employee? Does he detest computers? 
Bear a bitter grudge against a college professor? Is his motive revenge, or is 
he simply a twisted publicity hound?
</p><p class="body" align="Left">For 17 years, authorities say, a wily figure known as the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> has been on the loose in America, spreading terror and death through carefully 
polished bombs concealed inside parcels sent through the U.S. mail.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">His devices have injured 23 people and killed three others, including a 
lobbyist for timber companies who died in the latest attack at the California 
Forestry Assn. headquarters here on Monday afternoon.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A psychological profile suggests that the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> has little more than a high school education. Yet he has stumped this nation's 
sharpest crime-fighters, leading them on a confounding chase 
without precedent in the annals of criminology.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Now, after leaving a cold trail stretching back for years, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> has apparently broken his silence.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">On Tuesday, the FBI announced that authorities have obtained three letters from 
the serial bomber, postmarked April 20 from Oakland. At least two of the three 
letters arrived on the day of the bombing.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Jim R. Freeman, FBI special agent in charge of the San Francisco office, said 
that in the letters, the bomber describes his own actions and motives for the 
first time since he surfaced in 1978.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;We are hopeful there will be something in the content of the letters that will 
cause the public to recognize this individual,&quot; Freeman said. He added that the FBI may release details from the letters today.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">One of those letters was sent to the New York Times, which today is publishing 
a long, rambling message from someone claiming responsibility for the bombings.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the letter, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> declares himself a member of an anarchist group and declares his goal to be 
the 
&quot;destruction of the worldwide industrial system.&quot; His specific enemies are said to be 
&quot;scientists and engineers, especially in critical fields like computers and 
genetics.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Through our bombings, we hope to promote social instability in industrial 
society, propagate anti-industrial ideas and give encouragement to those who 
hate the industrial system,&quot; the letter states.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Declaring himself weary of making bombs and 
&quot;searching the Sierras for a place isolated enough&quot; to test them, the letter writer offers to halt the attacks if given a forum 
for his views. He demands space for an article of 
&quot;between 29,000 and 37,000 words&quot; in the New York Times, Time, Newsweek or other national periodical. He also 
demands the right to rebut any criticisms once a year for three 
years.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">If denied the opportunity, the letter writer vows to 
&quot;start building our next bomb,&quot; which he said might be more powerful than his previous creations and packed 
into 
&quot;more harmless looking packages.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The letter was postmarked Thursday and received by the newspaper Monday. It is 
signed with the initials 
&quot;FC,&quot; which have been found on many of the Unabom devices, and contains a nine-digit 
identification number that was included in a previous letter sent by the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> in 1993.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In a related development, the New York Times reported Tuesday that a Unabom 
victim -- Yale University computer sciences professor David Gelernter -- 
received a letter claiming to be from his attacker. It arrived before Monday's 
explosion and mocked the professor.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Gelernter, who was maimed in June, 1993, after receiving a parcel bomb mailed 
from Sacramento, could not be reached.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bomber has 
written a letter only once before. In June, 1993, he wrote the New York Times 
and claimed to be part of an anarchist group. Investigators discount that 
description, saying they believe he is acting alone.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Monday's explosion took the life of Gilbert Murray, 47, who was killed when he 
opened a shoebox-sized parcel that arrived through the mail and was wrapped in 
brown paper and nylon filament tape. The force of the blast struck Murray in 
the abdomen and caused extensive damage to the association's office. Metal bomb 
fragments were found 140 feet from the reception counter where Murray had been 
standing.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">On Tuesday, federal agents in rubber gloves and protective boots continued 
their painstaking probe at the California Forestry Assn. office, using metal 
detectors to scan ceiling tiles and wall paneling for shrapnel and other 
remnants of the pipe 
bomb.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">At a news conference, FBI officials said the deadly package was a wooden box, 
10 inches by 10 inches and 6 inches deep. It weighed five or six pounds, 
carried a return address in Oakland and also was postmarked in Oakland. 
Authorities said the bomb was not addressed to Murray. Instead, it was mailed 
to Murray's predecessor, William Dennison, who resigned a year ago after 
serving as association president for 14 years.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Freeman said the package was also mislabeled -- addressed to the California 
Timber Assn., a name the organization quit using four years ago.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;That means (the 
<strong>Unabomber)</strong> got ahold of a directory that was out of date,&quot; Dennison said. 
&quot;They didn't know Bill Dennison from Paul Bunyan. They were out of contact with 
what was going on in the last four years.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Murray, the latest Unabom victim, was described by a colleague as a model 
husband and father of two teen-age sons who was still an active soccer player.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Diana Wall, who worked with Murray at the forestry association for years, 
called him an extremely accomplished lobbyist who was sensitive to employees' 
personal needs.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Wall also said she was mystified as to 
&quot;why he'd open that box.&quot; She said the forestry association had received threats in the past, of which 
all employees were aware.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> has been blamed for 16 attacks over 17 years. Many of his attacks have had a 
Northern California connection. Seven of the 16 bombs originated in the region, 
with two of them bearing Sacramento postmarks. Two of the three Unabom 
fatalities were in Sacramento, and one device carried the return address of a 
chemistry professor at Cal State Sacramento.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Federal investigators said no one in U.S. history has ever set off as many 
bombs over such a long period of time. They describe him as one of the 
&quot;most wanted men&quot; in America.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;This is a person with an extraordinary amount of criminal savoir-faire,&quot; said James Alan Fox, dean of the College of Criminal Justice at Northeastern 
University in Boston. 
&quot;Not only is he good at making bombs, he's also been remarkably successful at 
covering his tracks.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">For years, investigators have puzzled over the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> maze of attacks, looking for a pattern, a theme, the tiniest shred of a clue. 
They have studied the 
&quot;FC&quot; autograph he leaves on some of his bombs -- and they have run computer 
searches on everything from a partial name on a note written by the bomber in 
1993 to various phases of the moon.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Early on, investigators suspected the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> was a person seeking vengeance against airlines. One of his targets included 
the former president of United Airlines, and another bomb exploded in a mailbag 
on an American Airlines flight.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Later, officials suspected a link with computers. The first person killed by 
one of his creations -- Hugh Scrutton, 38, of Sacramento -- was the owner of a 
Sacramento computer store, and another device was left in a computer store 
parking lot.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">More recently, investigators have wondered whether the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> is obsessed with wood. Many of his devices are encased in wood, and some 
include pieces of twigs. One victim was named Percy Wood and lived in Lake 
Forest, Ill. Another lived on Aspen Drive.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Two years ago, the federal government formed a task force, assigning as 
many as 40 agents to work full-time to crack the Unabom case -- so named 
because the attacker shows a preference for universities and airlines.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Authorities have also taken an unusual step -- turning to the public for help. 
They have set up a hot line (1-800-701-BOMB), appealed for tips on the Internet 
and offered a $1-million reward in the hope that a greedy accomplice might be 
tempted to talk.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Along the way, investigators have determined that the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> is a meticulous criminal who makes his bomb parts or uses common household 
items. At one point, he was dubbed the 
&quot;Junkyard Bomber&quot; because of his use of makeshift parts.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">After completing his creations, he takes them apart and builds them again. And 
he lovingly polishes his bombs, which are probably powered by chemicals he 
mixes himself.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Behavioral experts, meanwhile, have developed a 
&quot;best guess&quot; psychological profile of the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> based on his methods and interviews with other serial bombers. They believe he 
is a white male in his 30s or 40s, an antisocial loner who is quiet, meticulous 
and has trouble building relationships, particularly with women.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He probably drives an old car, but is likely to keep it in top condition. He 
prepares lists, and probably makes an excellent neighbor.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Fox, co-author of a recent book on serial killers, speculates that he is an 
&quot;unsuccessful person seeking to feel a sense of control through these bombings.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;He wants to have an impact, to be recognized,&quot; Fox said. 
&quot;He considers himself very good at what he does and bombing gives him a sense of 
pride.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> debut is believed to have come in 1978, with a bomb concealed in an unmailed 
package found in a 
parking lot at the University of Illinois in Chicago.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The only known sighting of a suspect came in 1987, when a witness spotted a man 
placing what turned out to be a bomb behind a computer store in Salt Lake City. 
He was described as a white male with a ruddy complexion, and reddish blond 
hair, most of it hidden beneath the hood of a sweat shirt.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Based on that description, a composite sketch was drawn. It brought numerous 
calls, but produced no solid results.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Occasionally, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> has taken long breaks, prompting suspicions that he might have died or been 
arrested and jailed for other crimes. His longest break lasted six years, and 
followed the release of the composite sketch. But in 1993, he surfaced again.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Experts said finding the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> is complicated 
by the fact that his bombs leave little physical evidence, and that he is not 
present at the crime scene. There are no fingerprints, no hairs or blood or 
semen.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Advances in DNA evidence, however, may make it possible to analyze saliva 
traces on an envelope or stamp. And metal and chemical industry laboratories 
are working with the task force to pin down where the bomb materials were made 
and sold.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Eventually he'll slip up and we'll catch him,&quot; said Ed Gleba, a spokesman for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms. 
&quot;The sooner the better.&quot;

in Sacramento and Maura Dolan in San Francisco.

BACKGROUND (Southland Edition, A29)
</p><p class="body" align="Left">FBI officials made up the code name Unabom from the words 
<em>university 
</em>(UN), 
<em>airlines 
</em>(A) and 
<em>bomb 
</em>(BOM), because of repeated 
targeting of those two institutions by the serial bomber. Beginning with an 
attack in 1978 at Northwestern University, nine bombs attributed to the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> have been mailed to university personnel. Eight people were injured at or near 
eight campuses; a device was disarmed at a ninth campus. Three Unabom attacks 
were airline- or aircraft-related -- one mailed to the home of a United 
Airlines president, one planted on a passenger jet and one sent to the Boeing 
Co. in Washington state. Thirteen injuries resulted, 12 of them from smoke 
inhalation by passengers aboard the airliner. In all, the FBI attributes 16 
attacks to the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> in 17 years, resulting in three deaths and 23 injuries.
