</p><p class="body" align="Left">A New Forum for Elders 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">If there was any chance that Joycelyn Elders would limp quietly back to 
Arkansas in defeat, the former surgeon general puts that thought to bed in, of 
all places, Playboy. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In a wide-ranging interview in the June issue, which will appear on newsstands 
next week, the outspoken woman who sent some conservatives into a tizzy with 
her remarks on masturbation takes aim at the religious right in her familiar 
take-no-prisoners style. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;They are not the Christians I know about. They are the Jerry Falwell-Pat 
Robertson Christians,&quot; she says of the people she disdainfully refers to as the 
&quot;religious non-Christian right.&quot; 
&quot;They pay homage to religious economists. . . . People who use religion to get 
money from people who don't know better.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">She doesn't mince words when it comes to others like Newt Gingrich, saying of 
the House speaker, 
&quot;He's only concerned about building him.&quot; She calls Clarence Thomas 
&quot;an Uncle Tom&quot; and Jesse Helms a 
&quot;typical white, Southern, male bigot.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">It was just this bluntness, coupled with the infamous comment that masturbation 
is 
&quot;part of something that perhaps should be taught,&quot; that prompted President Clinton to demand her resignation in December. Despite 
reports to the contrary, Elders insists she got no earlier warnings from Chief 
of Staff Leon Panetta. 
&quot;I never talked with Mr. Panetta but once in my life: when he called and asked 
me to resign. There was this idea that I had been taken to the woodshed and 
been warned. But he never talked with me.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Elders, who's known Clinton since his Arkansas governor days, professes no ill 
will toward the president. And she is categorically unapologetic about her 
views 
on masturbation: 
&quot;We've been taught for a long time that you'll go blind, you'll go crazy. . . . 
I say: Teach children the facts and not the lies we've been espousing.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">SOLD 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Condos in this apparently well-located Pennsylvania Avenue building have 
recently been sold to Rep. Bob Torricelli of New Jersey (top) and Sen. Paul 
Coverdell of Georgia, for $ 177,900 and $ 158,818, respectively. We hope Bob's 
is bigger for the extra 19 G's. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">We've Heard That . . .  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">* As further proof that Saturday's White House Correspondents Association 
dinner fell a bit flat, Vanity Fair Editor Graydon Carter fled his own 
post-dinner party to have a drink with ballerina Heather Watts at the Jefferson 
Hotel. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">* In their mutual suck-up Saturday night at the dinner, presidential hopeful 
Lamar Alexander gushed to 
Sen. Fred Thompson, 
&quot;You're the toast of the town!&quot; Thompson shot back: 
&quot;Well, look at the town.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">* Chef Roberto Donna's night suddenly got a lot busier Sunday when, in the 
middle of his whipping up an 11-course meal for guest Julia Child at his 
restaurant Galileo, in walked first lady Hillary Clinton and former Texas 
governor Ann Richards. Donna just doubled up orders on those multiple courses. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">* Hot couple Hugh Grant and Elizabeth Hurley, the new Estee Lauder face, will 
be in town next week for a benefit premiere of the actor's new flick, 
&quot;The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill but Came Down a Mountain.&quot; The British Embassy reception and screening at the Avalon benefits Sasha Bruce 
Youthwork, 
a private nonprofit foundation that helps troubled youths and their families. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">* Penthouse and Omni magazine publisher Bob Guccione offered yesterday to 
publish a lengthy article by the serial bomber dubbed the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> in order 
&quot;to save lives.&quot; In a letter to the New York Times last week, the terrorist suggested that he 
would stop sending mail bombs if a 
&quot;widely read, nationally distributed periodical&quot; published his manuscript. In a letter publicized yesterday, Guccione told the 
bomber: 
&quot;I am making one or several of my magazines available to publicize your message. 
. . . Furthermore, I would dedicate our entire public relations operation to 
help publicize your message.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">* Harper's senior editor and writer Michael Lind will be leaving to join the 
New Republic any day now. And tomorrow night New Republic Editor 
Andrew Sullivan hosts a fund-raising party at his home to benefit AIDS research 
at the Mapplethorpe Laboratory in Boston.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">* Rep. Maxine Waters, Sen. Paul Simon, United Negro College Fund President Bill 
Gray, actor-activist Danny Glover and Digital Equipment Corp. are the first 
recipients of the Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu Human Rights Awards. Tutu, the 
South African archbishop, will be in town Thursday for the Ritz-Carlton 
presentation, timed to coincide with the first anniversary of free elections in 
his country. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">* Joe Eszterhas, the highest-paid scriptwriter in Hollywood (&quot;Basic Instinct&quot;), was forced to take his latest effort out of circulation because of a lack of 
interest. Variety reports that no big money came forth for 
&quot;Blaze of Glory,&quot; about the life of singer Otis Redding. Eszterhas 
issued a statement that said: 
&quot;We had no offers. This is my fourth spec that I have not sold. You win some of 
these and you lose some.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">* Paula Barbieri, O.J. Simpson's main squeeze, is fleeing Los Angeles. The 
model and actress has put her West L.A. condo up for sale 
&quot;because she has another home in Florida and intends to make that her primary 
residence,&quot; her attorney tells the Los Angeles Times. Barbieri, 26, is from Florida.
