</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong> 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Conceding that they are stumped in the 
<strong>Unabom</strong> case, federal investigators released several intriguing new clues about the 
mystery bomber in order to generate public interest. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;That's where this case is going to be solved -- through public involvement,&quot; Jim Freeman, head of the FBI's San Francisco office, said Wednesday.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">After 15 bombs blamed on the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> over the last 16 years that have injured 22 people and killed two, authorities 
have been unable to come up with the bomber's identity or even his motive. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A $ 1-million reward has not helped, although investigators have received an 
estimated 3,100 calls on the toll-free tipster line (1-800-701-BOMB) since 
Sunday. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The mail bomb that killed a New Jersey advertising executive Saturday listed a 
return addressee of 
&quot;H.C. Wickel&quot; of the Department of Economics at San Francisco State University on its typed 
return label, the FBI said Wednesday. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">But no one by that name has ever taught or studied at the school, said Daniel 
Hagberg, chief postal inspector in San Francisco. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 45-member 
<strong>Unabom</strong> task force is seeking 
calls from anyone with information about the name. Authorities have interviewed 
people in northern California with the surname Wickel but to no avail. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Paul Snabel, head of the San Francisco office of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms, said 
<strong>Unabom</strong> investigators were considering the possibility that the name was an anagram or 
a literary reference of significance to the bomber. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">So far, investigators have found nothing from the New Jersey bomb with the 
initials 
&quot;FC,&quot; which had been a trademark of previous 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> devices, Freeman said. The meaning of the letters is unknown.
