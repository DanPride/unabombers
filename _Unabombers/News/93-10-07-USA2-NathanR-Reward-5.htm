</p><p class="body" align="Left">Federal authorities Wednesday offered a $ 1 million reward for information 
that helps catch the elusive 
&quot;<strong>unabomber&quot;</strong> who has killed one person and injured 23 others since 1978.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;We do not have any viable suspects at this time and we need the public's help,&quot; said George Clow, who heads an FBI task force of 45.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
&quot;<strong>unabomber&quot;</strong> - so named because two of his targets are universities and airlines - has been 
linked to 14 bombings since 1978.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Clow said a psychological profile indicates that the bomber, who last struck 
this summer, will attack again.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Investigators Wednesday said they believe a mysterious note with the 
inscription 
&quot;Call Nathan R--Wed 7 PM&quot; could have been written by the bomber to himself.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Investigators did not say where or how the note was found. Authorities hope 
&quot;Nathan&quot; or someone who knows him will come forward.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bomber is believed to have made the call to 
&quot;Nathan&quot; in June, the same month two mail bombs exploded in California and Connecticut.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The targets have included university professors and others associated with the 
airline and computer industries. But no clear motive has emerged.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The most recent bombs were mailed June 18 from Sacramento to professors at the 
University of California at San Francisco and at Yale University.  The sole 
death occurred in December 1985 when 
Hugh Scrutton, 38, picked up a bomb at his computer rental store.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bomber is 
&quot;acting out something,&quot; said Clow. An FBI profile suggests the bomber is:
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A white male, single or divorced, in late 40s or early 50s.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Neat and meticulous - someone who may appear to be a 
&quot;nice guy&quot; except for a macabre sense of humor.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The government has contributed $ 450,000 of the reward money; $ 550,000 was 
pledged by unidentified private donors. A federal toll-free number for tips: 
1-800-701-BOMB. All information will be confidential.
