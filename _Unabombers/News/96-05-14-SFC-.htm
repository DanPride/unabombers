</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> Kevin Fagan, Chronicle Staff Writer 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong></p><p class="body" align="Left">It's a wild longshot, but San Francisco detectives are looking into what would 
be one of the more amazing criminal developments in modern times if true: the 
possibility that 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> suspect Theodore J. Kaczynski is also the infamous Zodiac killer.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The new twist to the investigation was spurred by calls to police from amateur 
sleuths who were struck by similarities among Kaczynski, the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> crimes and details from the saga of the Zodiac, a never-identified man who 
shocked the nation with his string of slayings and taunting letters in the 
1960s and '70s.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Among the possible links are that Kaczynski lived in the Bay Area from 1967 to 
1969, the same period that the Zodiac's confirmed killings occurred in 
California, and that Kaczynski once signed a high school yearbook with a symbol 
similar to the Zodiac's. The Zodiac also told one victim that he had resided in 
Montana near Lincoln, the town 
Kaczynski lived near when he was arrested last month.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Also similar was the evident pleasure that both the Unabomber and the Zodiac 
took in bragging in letters to newspapers -- both wrote to The Chronicle -- and 
in ridiculing investigators.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Still skeptical at best, San Francisco detectives have asked the FBI for copies 
of Kaczynski's fingerprints to see if they match a bloody print from one Zodiac 
slaying scene, and yesterday they pulled three boxes of files from storage to 
sift for new clues.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''Some of it is pretty farfetched, but there are enough similarities for us to 
at least look at it,'' said Vince Repetto, a San Francisco homicide inspector 
assigned to the Zodiac probe. ''It's not like this is a full-fledged 
investigation into this angle, . . . but then you just don't want to ignore 
it.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Despite the common threads, there are plenty of differences between the Zodiac 
killer and the Unabomber. Chief among them are their 
methods of killing. The Zodiac killer used guns and knives; the Unabomber 
employed bombs to leave three dead and 23 injured since 1978.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">If the fingerprints match, or if solid links appear between the copious 
writings of the Unabomber and the Zodiac, detectives may ask the FBI for more 
documents, Repetto said. They may also run DNA tests comparing Kaczynski's 
saliva with that on old Zodiac envelopes.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">FBI spokesman George Grotz said his agency, which has headed the Unabomber 
probe, will ''turn over anything they (San Francisco police) ask for if it 
helps them.'' He said he could not comment on possible links between the two 
cases.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Robert 
<strong>Graysmith</strong> of San Francisco, author of the book ''Zodiac'' in 1986, said the similarities 
are ''fascinating'' but undoubtedly purely coincidental.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">For one, witness descriptions of a paunchy Zodiac do not 
match the lanky Kaczynski, said 
<strong>Graysmith,</strong> who is now writing a Unabomber book.  The pop-culture writing style of the 
Zodiac also does not match the Unabomber's terse, dry prose.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Michael Rosconi, a Campbell businessman who has been the most ardent among 
those urging a probe of Unabomber-Zodiac links, said he wrote to the police 
because he ''just couldn't shake the feeling that the two killers are the 
same.''
