<strong>HEADLINE:</strong> Maybe the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> wasn't alone 

<br>

<strong>BYLINE:</strong> Robert 
<strong>Graysmith</strong> 

<br>
<br>
<strong>BODY:</strong>
<br>When FBI agents swarmed into Ted Kaczynski's Montana cabin on
<br>April 3, 1996, they unearthed 
&quot;a mother lode of evidence&quot; that
<br>he was the 
<strong>Unabomber.</strong> The case seemed open and shut.
<br>
<br><br>But as jury selection opens up Wednesday, serious questions about
<br>the government's case remain.
<br>
<br><br>The FBI logged 720 items of evidence from the cabin. Agents searched
<br>that cabin so thoroughly they cataloged lint and dust. But what
<br>may be more important is what they did not find.
<br> 

<br><br>The cabin had no electricity, no lights, no power of any kind.
<br>Yet the suspected terrorist bomber, the subject of the longest
<br>search in FBI history, had built sophisticated bombs, cutting,
<br>welding and drilling metal pieces to do so. Where were the tools?
<br>
<br><br>In the cabin FBI agents ferreted out a blue and red wooden-handled
<br>manual drill, seven wood drill bits, one drill base and a welding
<br>mask.
<br>
<br><br>It's highly unlikely that those tools alone could have built the
<br>Unabomber's weapons.
<br>
<br><br>-- There was no power drill, though the Unabomber's pipe bombs
<br>had precisely drilled fittings to secure the metal end caps that
<br>sealed the explosive inside.
<br>
<br><br>-- There also was no electric welding set (and no gas tank or
<br>acetylene torch for a gas welding set). But beading and a change
<br>in the pearl-like grain of metal 
on the finished welded end plates
<br>of the bombs suggest high temperatures had been reached, such
<br>as the 6,300-degree heat from an oxyacetylene welding torch.
<br>
<br><br>The fire pit in Kaczynski's garden might have generated high temperatures,
<br>but it seems unlikely he could have done any detailed welding
<br>work in such a place.
<br>
<br><br>Each of the Unabomber's devices, with the exception of the first
<br>two, showed over-soldering. There was solder in that cabin, but
<br>no soldering iron.
<br>
<br><br>Penciled numbers on the bomb pieces show that the devices were
<br>assembled and reassembled many times before being finished. Could
<br>he read those marks in the cabin's very dim light?
<br>
<br><br>Kaczynski could have worked outside, either to assemble the bombs
<br>or work the metal in the fire pit, but agents had the suspect
<br>and the cabin under surveillance for two months before his arrest.
<br>Surely they would have seem him at this. Yet when they 
seized
<br>the cabin, they found a live bomb wrapped and ready to mail. Where
<br>had that come from?
<br>
<br><br>Was there a hidden lab? And, if so, whose was it?
<br>
<br><br>Kaczynski was a poor man. In an 18-year crime spree he spent only
<br>a few thousand dollars. Outfitting his own machine shop or bomb
<br>lab was surely beyond his means.
<br>
<br><br>Had the accused secretly gained access to welding equipment in
<br>Lincoln or Helena, test-detonated his devices in the remote Scapegoat
<br>Wilderness and gathered components from the many junk piles owned
<br>by his neighbors? And if there was a lab or machine shop belonging
<br>to someone else, did he know Kaczynski was using it?
<br>
<br><br>Until we know where and how the Unabomber made his bombs, the
<br>possibility of an accomplice cannot be ruled out.
<br>
<br><br>There are other hints that there may be an accomplice. The Unabomber
<br>used the Park Hotel in Helena, Mont., as a 
halfway house, staying
<br>there before he left the state and when he returned. For every
<br>bombing, we can fix a stay at the Park hotel before and after.
<br>
<br><br>There is only one exception. The registration records do not show
<br>any stay at the Park Hotel bracketing the bombing that killed
<br>Hugh Scrutton, one of the murders for which Kaczynski is about
<br>to go on trial.
<br>
<br><br>Moreover, a bank deposit slip, apparently on a Helena bank for
<br>one of his three accounts, dated Dec. 11, 1985, places the former
<br>mathematics professor in Montana while the bomb that killed Scrutton
<br>was being placed in Sacramento.
<br>
<br><br>FBI agent Terry Turchie wrote in his detailed affidavit that the
<br>Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms 
&quot;has been unable to determine
<br>as yet whether this posting date accurately indicates that Theodore
<br>Kaczynski personally made a 
deposit on that day.&quot; If that loophole
<br>stays open, it is a big one. It would have taken the accused 251/2
<br>hours by bus, which is how he always traveled, to get to Sacramento
<br>to place that bomb.
<br>
<br><br>Of course, with the trial and Kaczynski's detailed diaries, we
<br>will eventually know the answer to these and other inconsistencies.
<br>
<br><br>I can hardly wait.
