Circulated in Academia

</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI has given copies of a 35,000-word manifesto written by the terrorist 
known as the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> to dozens of university professors in the hope they can 
<strong>identify</strong> the writing as the product of a former student or colleague. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bomber, believed by authorities to be responsible for killing three people 
and injuring 23 since 1978, sent the manuscript in June to the New York Times 
and The Washington Post, saying he would refrain from killing anyone else if 
either paper published it in its entirety within three months. Neither paper 
has made a decision yet. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Many of the professors shown the manuscript, a learned screed against 
technology, are experts in the history of science.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;What we're trying to stress is this whole idea of the history of science, and 
people who might have been in the right places at the right time, who have 
maybe seen or heard comments from someone whose words and writings are very 
similar to this,&quot; Terry Turchie, assistant special agent in charge of the San Francisco-based 
UNABOM Task Force, said yesterday. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Members of the task force believe the bomber was exposed to the history of 
science or some related discipline in the late 1970s in the Chicago area, 
possibly at the University of Illinois at Chicago or at Northwestern 
University, where the first two bombs were found. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI believes he then moved to the Salt Lake City area in 1980 and 1981, 
then finally to Northern California, where he may have had 
&quot;some sort of contact&quot; with the University of California at Berkeley, in the words of an FBI 
statement to be made public today. Two 
bombs were placed in a computer sciences building at Berkeley in 1982 and 1985. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Obviously the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> knows his way in and around a college campus. Whether or not he's been 
successful in achieving advanced degrees is subject to speculation,&quot; said Jim R. Freeman, special agent in charge of the San Francisco office. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">For much of his criminal career the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> chose to remain unnervingly silent about what seemed to be a random campaign 
against unrelated industries and academic fields. The FBI called him UNABOM 
because his early targets worked in universities or for airlines. The bomber 
called himself 
&quot;FC,&quot; for Freedom Club, though the FBI thinks the membership in the group is limited 
to the bomber himself. The only credible sighting of the bomber was in 1987, 
outside a Salt Lake City computer store just before 
an explosion. He was decribed by a 
<strong>witness</strong> as a man with curly reddish-blond hair and a light mustache. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">He resurfaced six years later, in June 1993 when, two days apart, university 
professors were seriously injured with mail bombs. While only one person was 
killed in the first 14 incidents, his two most recent bombs proved lethal, last 
December when a New Jersey advertising executive opened a bomb in his house, 
and then in April when the president of the California Forestry Association was 
killed in his office by a mail bomb addressed to someone else. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">With that incident the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> suddenly became discursive, sending letters to newspapers, a former victim, a 
college professor and, most dramatically, unveiling his manifesto, entitled, 
&quot;Industrial Society and Its Future.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI has placed no restrictions 
on the professors who have been given copies of the manuscript. They can copy 
it and share it with whomever they want, or conceivably even make the text 
available on the Internet. Of this last possibility, Turchie said, 
&quot;We haven't encouraged that.&quot; Asked if the FBI had thought of posting it on the Net, Turchie said, 
&quot;It wasn't sent to us. It's not really ours to publish or make public.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">When he sent the manuscript to The Post and the Times, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> enclosed a letter saying the Times has first claim to publish the manuscript 
and that 
&quot;the same bargain&quot; is offered to The Post if the Times does not print it or have it published 
&quot;reasonably soon.&quot; Penthouse magazine has offered to publish the manuscript, but the bomber said 
that if it is the only publication that publishes it, he will plant another 
bomb with the intention to kill. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;We are continuing to talk it over with people at the New York Times and are 
consulting with responsible 
public officials,&quot; Donald E. Graham, publisher of The Post, said yesterday. 
&quot;The document we received was postmarked June 24, and said that first the Times 
and then The Post would have three months to think it over. And quite obviously 
it takes some thinking about. It is not an easy decision.&quot; 
<a name="Excerpts"> </a>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Excerpts of the manifesto, about 3,000 words, are being published in today's 
Post. Leonard Downie Jr., The Post's executive editor, said the excerpts would 
permit readers to see some of the material the FBI is making available to the 
academic community. 
&quot;While the excerpts are a small fraction of the whole document, they are 
representative of the thoughts in it,&quot; Downie said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The document draws on a mix of academic disciplines, notably psychology and 
sociology, to argue that individuals in modern society are too easily able to 
meet their basic needs for survival, and suffer from a 
&quot;disruption&quot; of the 
&quot;power process,&quot; which leads to depression, low self-esteem, guilt, anxiety, sexual perversion, 
etc. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">One retired professor of government who has written about technology and 
received the manifesto from the FBI on Monday said he was impressed by the 
bomber's intelligence. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I was surprised how bright this guy seems. It could have stood a lot of 
editing, obviously. It was remarkably coherent and precise. His prescription is 
absurd, but I liked a good deal of his diagnosis,&quot; the professor said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Keith Benson, executive secretary of the History of Science Society in Seattle, 
said yesterday he was shown letters last October written by the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> including one in which he said he had been a doctoral degree candidate in 
history at the University of Utah, working on a dissertation about the history 
of the behavioral sciences. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Based on what he read, 
Benson said of the anarchist, 
&quot;He's smart enough to talk fairly knowledgeably about the history of science.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">One historian whose work is cited in the UNABOM manuscript, Roger Lane of 
Haverford College, said that based on a description of the citation, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> basically understood his thesis, that the industrial revolution brought a 
degree of conformity to Americans that had not been necessary to citizens in 
more solitary pursuits such as farming. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;This is not a volume that was ever a major best-seller, and that he should have 
gone through it carefully is very interesting,&quot; Lane said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI has at least 150 people working on the case. Freeman and Turchie said 
yesterday they are optimistic they can catch the 
<strong>Unabomber.</strong> 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;We're not frustrated. We're very motivated,&quot; Freeman said. 
&quot;We're very confident we're going to solve the case.&quot;
