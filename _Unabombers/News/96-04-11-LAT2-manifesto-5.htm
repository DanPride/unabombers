</p><p class="subheader" align="left"><strong>HEADLINE:</strong> 35,000 WORDS PAINT A PICTURE 



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> K.C. COLE, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER
 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong> 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">They say a picture is worth a thousand words, but to scientists trying to peer 
into the mind of the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> words have painted a revealing picture of this most intellectual of killers. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In his 35,000-word manifesto, the killer not only laid out his frustration with 
high-tech modern society, he also left a trail of linguistic clues that told 
word specialists a great deal about him. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;That manuscript was as lovingly crafted as his bombs,&quot; said forensic psychologist Richard Ault, for years a behavioral specialist at 
the FBI. 
&quot;Writing is a form of behavior,&quot; he said, and so can be used as surely as other evidence to pin down the 
identity of a suspect. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;We reveal ourselves through language,&quot; said forensic psychologist N.G. Berrill, director of the New York Forensic 
Mental Health Group. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Experts agree that little of scientific value can be gleaned merely by looking 
at the loops and flourishes of an individual's handwriting. But the words and 
paragraphs themselves speak volumes about who a person is, how he thinks and 
where he comes from. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">For those who know how to look under the surface, everything from geography to 
age to emotional state to identity lies buried in the words. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Not all specialists agree that personality or emotional state can be read into 
a person's words. Psychologists who work with law enforcement, like Ault and 
Berrill, tend to be more optimistic about their ability to find these hidden 
layers of meaning. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">People like the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> said Berrill, reveal themselves in writing as 
people who are very disconnected from society. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;You don't see them incorporating others into their world view,&quot; he said. 
&quot;They live in their heads. Nowhere is there warmth, or empathy or connection 
with others. These are the night watchmen, the people who live alone in single 
rooms.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Linguists, on the other hand, concentrate on stylistic idiosyncrasies, often as 
individual as fingerprints, that can be used to 
<strong>identify</strong> the writer from a group of suspects. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The first few pages of the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> manifesto revealed a number of these quirks, said linguist Gerald McMenamin of 
Cal State Fresno, who analyzed parts of the manifesto for The Times. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">For example, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> always writes 
&quot;pre-industrial&quot; with a hyphen, but the compound word 
&quot;smallscale&quot; without a hyphen. He begins many sentences with 
&quot;Thus,&quot; and inserts strings of lowercase x's throughout the text. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The experts generally agree that writing style can link 
people to distinctive groups, based on gender, ethnic background, age, locale 
or even time period. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Individuals develop idiosyncratic linguistic styles that are identifiable,&quot; said McMenamin. 
&quot;It's much like DNA fingerprinting.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Instead of comparing strands of genetic material, word experts analyze telltale 
literary quirks. And while many people might share one of the same quirks, it's 
highly unlikely that they would share three or more. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;You and I may have trouble spelling 
&quot;ie&quot; words, or leave a space after opening a parenthesis,&quot; said McMenamin. 
&quot;But even if we share two, we wouldn't share three, and we certainly wouldn't 
share 20.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Any word usage that stands out can be used to 
<strong>identify</strong> an author. 
&quot;I was at the doctor's office yesterday,&quot; said McMenamin, 
&quot;and the nurse told me to roll over on my 
tummy. I'm a grown man, 52 years old.&quot; The word 
&quot;tummy&quot; would be out of place in that context, he said. 
&quot;I notice these anomalies.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Once the analyst compiles a list of linguistic markers from a certain piece of 
writing, he can compare the list to another piece of writing from a suspect. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">McMenamin frequently gets called in to analyze letters written by disgruntled 
employees. He'll compare the letters to a known sample of the person's writings 
and look for those characteristic verbal tics that give people away. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Teenage girls who put little hearts over their i's, that's obvious, but what 
about someone who capitalizes all the letters in the first word of every 
sentence?&quot; Or whose language shows traces of a first language that isn't English? 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;You look for those little skip jumps,&quot; said Ault, 
&quot;like malapropisms: 'He died of neurosis of the liver.' Or hyperbole: 'That 
dastardly perfidious manager.' 
&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">University of Seattle psychologist Elizabeth Loftus looks at what she calls 
&quot;suspicious&quot; use of language. 
&quot;If someone says, 'The wallpaper was green, the color of mint juleps,' we have 
books that can tell you the normal frequency of mint juleps in language.&quot; If the use of 
&quot;mint juleps&quot; is far more frequent than usual, it might indicate that the author is from the 
South. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Highly educated people tend to share a common writing style, which makes them 
harder to 
<strong>identify,</strong> said McMenamin, because they are schooled in a common culture. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">With a well-educated author like the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> it could take 100 pages or more to draw any firm conclusions. Like many 
schooled authors, the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> text was strung together with complex sentences and crammed with clauses. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">More subtle kinds of analyses can be done with what 
linguists call 
&quot;function words,&quot; such as 
&quot;the&quot; 
&quot;and&quot; 
&quot;but,&quot; that one would leave out in a telegram if paying by the word. Linguists look 
at the way people string these words together in groups of two or three (&quot;if only&quot; or 
&quot;and if&quot;) and use the frequency as markers that can be as accurate as fingerprints. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Experts part company, however, when it comes to reading someone's state of mind 
from the words they write or speak. Forensic psychologists like Ault have more 
faith than linguists in the process. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">An author who strings together clauses like Christmas lights, says Ault, is 
likely to feel passionate about his cause. 
&quot;Sometimes it's quadruple compounds with hyphenated clauses, because they want 
to cram everything in.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Passions also come through in the way writers begin letters, he said. 
&quot;If he's angry or impatient, he starts in mid-thought. A letter carefully 
addressed to the CEO of 
a company might start: 'You know John is NOT the sort of person who . . .' It 
assumes the CEO is familiar with the case.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Underlying layers of meaning can spill out between the lines even in spoken 
words. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In a recent case, Berrill took a deposition from a woman who described the 
horror of a dental procedure gone wrong. She used graphic terms, such as 
&quot;scraping out my insides.&quot; That suggested to Berrill that she was really remembering the horror of a 
recent abortion. 
&quot;I would suspect this person is Roman Catholic and very conflicted.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In his manifesto, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> wrote about people who are 
&quot;frustrated&quot; and want 
&quot;peace and quiet,&quot; and people who 
&quot;spend their lives leaning on the rails.&quot; This is a classic case, said Ault, of what psychologists call projective 
thinking--or projecting one's own feelings onto someone else. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;He was ostensibly writing 
about other people,&quot; said Ault, 
&quot;but he was clearly talking about himself.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Still, even Ault cautions that reading personality into writing style is more 
an art than a science. 
&quot;There are word counts you can do, and you can put it in a computer, but what it 
boils down to is human interpretation. You lick your thumb and you feel where 
the wind's coming from.&quot;
