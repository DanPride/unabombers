</p><p class="body" align="Left">HELENA, Mont. - Bowing to pleas by the federal government, a federal judge 
yesterday refused to unseal documents outlining the FBI's case against 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> suspect Theodore Kaczynski.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">U.S. District Judge Charles Lovell cited the need to protect 
&quot;the integrity of the investigation and the privacy interests&quot; of potential 
<strong>witnesses,</strong> particularly the Kaczynski family, which alerted the FBI that Kaczynski was 
probably the 
<strong>Unabomber.</strong>  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Release of the documents had been sought by The Denver Post, The New York Times 
and NBC.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Terry Turchie, the FBI agent supervising the Unabom Squad, said disclosure of 
the search-warrant affidavit, and Kaczynski's letters to his family, 
&quot;could disrupt the FBI's relationship with members of Mr. Kaczynski's family.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;In order to elicit the full cooperation of the family, the FBI agreed at the 
family's request to protect the contents of Mr. Kaczynski's letters from the 
public to the extent possible,&quot; Turchie said in an affidavit filed yesterday.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Denver Post believes the documents are public and should be released.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Helena lawyer John Morrison, who represented The Post, told the judge that 
there was little chance that making the documents public would hinder an 
investigation. The only suspect, he said, was Kaczynski and his cabin had been 
secured and thoroughly searched by federal agents. Kaczynski can't flee, 
destroy evidence or intimidate 
<strong>witnesses,</strong> said 
Morrison.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Morrison added that release of the documents will reduce speculation, end 
inaccuracies and half-truths and make public discussion of the case more 
informed. Assistant U.S. Attorney Bernie Hubley said the affidavit recounts 
events that led investigators to search Kaczynski's residence, 
&quot;including a substantial amount of information received from members of 
Kaczynski's family.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Hubley disputed assertions by the media that the investigation is 
&quot;essentially complete.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Kaczynski has been charged with keeping bomb components in his Lincoln, Mont., 
cabin, but more charges may be brought against him, said Hubley.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The search-warrant affidavit describes a series of crimes occurring over an 
18-year period, including 16 bombings and three murders,&quot; he said. 
&quot;No one has been charged with any of these offenses, and they remain the subject 
of a pending grand jury investigation.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The grand jury is to convene 
in Great Falls on Wednesday.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Hubley said the FBI's 
&quot;overt&quot; investigation is only a few weeks old, and an 
&quot;extraordinary amount of work remains to be done.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The FBI was unable to pursue many leads until Kaczynski was in custody for fear 
that he would learn of the investigation; now that he is in custody, 
investigators must follow up on those leads,&quot; he said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The government charged that unsealing the affidavit would significantly damage 
the investigation, because it names potential 
<strong>witnesses</strong> to bombings.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">It also outlines many facts known by the FBI about the bombings, about 
Kaczynski's whereabouts during them and about his use of 
&quot;commercial establishments,&quot; said Hubley.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">FBI agent Turchie claimed the media already has caused problems for the FBI.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Within the past few days, the media interviewed the manager of a Sacramento 
hotel who 'identified' Mr. Kaczynski as having stayed there 
on several occasions in years past,&quot; said Turchie. 
&quot;That same individual was interviewed by FBI agents within the past few weeks 
and was unable to 
<strong>identify</strong> a photograph of Mr. Kaczynski.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The FBI has again interviewed this individual, who has advised that the media 
had misquoted him and that he thought Mr. Kaczynski had been seen in the area 
of the hotel. He has no records to support this, and told the FBI he had no 
records of hotel stays.&quot;
