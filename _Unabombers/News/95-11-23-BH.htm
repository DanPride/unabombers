</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> By Wayne Woodlief 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">There may be only one thing on the political planet on which Sen. John Kerry 
and Pat Buchanan agree: Public financing of presidential elections has to be 
rescued from the hypocritical bid by some Senate Republicans to sink it.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Senate Budget Committee's scheme to abolish a voluntary $ 3 per taxpayer 
checkoff is due for floor debate this week.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Since four Republican senators, opposed to public financing in the past, are 
running, the GOP-dominated budget committee added this cynical little wrinkle: 
The checkoff wouldn't be eliminated until 2000.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">After me, the deluge; that seemed to be the message from aides to the four - 
Majority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, Phil Gramm of Texas, Arlen Specter of 
Pennsylvania and Richard Lugar of Indiana - who said they'd take the money and 
run in '96 but might vote to deny it to others in four years.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">It's silly for budget hawks to pretend $ 300 million in presidential funds 
makes any dent at all in the $ 1 trillion we need to balance the budget by 2002.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The harm, Kerry said, would be so much worse, escalating the 
&quot;extraordinary impact of (private) money in American politics&quot; and bringing back the bad old days of Watergate that public financing was 
created to curb.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Buchanan backs up Kerry. Philosophically, Buchanan dislikes public financing. 
Practically, as Bay Buchanan, his sister and campaign chairwoman, 
admits, it's 
&quot; the only way a populist candidate can win.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Precisely. For those who like their conservatism raw, there's no way Buchanan, 
&quot;B-1 Bob&quot; Dornan or Alan Keyes could even think of competing against Dole or Gramm 
without public funds.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 1996 Republican race already has been deprived of some good men - Jack 
Kemp, Bill Bennett, Dick Cheney - because of the need to raise huge amounts of 
money. It kept Dan Quayle out, too.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Budget Committee would 
&quot;go back to the dark days of Watergate,&quot; said Ann McBride, president of the citizens' group Common Cause.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">How bad was the influence of money in President Nixon's Watergate heyday? 
Consider:
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Ambassadorships were virtually up for sale to the highest bidder. They didn't 
come cheap. The ambassador to France gave $ 303,000. It cost the ambassador to 
Great 
Britain $ 250,000, the ambassador to Luxembourg $ 300,000.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Shakedowns were bald. A Gulf Oil executive said, 
&quot;I considered it considerable pressure when two Cabinet officers . . . asked me 
for funds. That's just a little bit different than somebody collecting for the 
Boy Scouts.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
&quot;In almost every aspect of Watergate, there was one common element: the flow of 
secret campaign cash,&quot; said Common Cause in a 1986 report.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">No wonder Nixon told John Dean 
&quot;It would be no problem&quot; to raise a million dollars in hush money for the Watergate burglars to keep 
the lid on the 
&quot;White House horrors.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Talk-show host G. Gordon Liddy, obscenely 
&quot;honored&quot; with a Freedom of Speech award by the National Association of Radio Talk Show 
Hosts, was one of the Watergate burglars.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Such an 
award after Liddy advised listeners to 
&quot;go for a head shot&quot; against federal agents in bulletproof vests who might darken their doors is as 
daffy as if an editors' society gave a freedom of the press award to Penthouse 
Magazine for offering to print the lunacies of the 
<strong>Unabomber.</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Public financing has not taken all special interest influence out of politics. 
Big donors skirted it with $ 85 million in unrestricted donations to both 
national committees in 1993-1994.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But the influence of big bucks has at least been curbed. This phony 
&quot;budget-cutting&quot; device must not be allowed to let special interests back in by the front door. 
The back door is bad enough.
