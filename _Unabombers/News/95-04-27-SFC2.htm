 Letters reveal a smart but increasingly pa

</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> a hitherto secretive man who now apparently craves publicity, is intelligent, 
articulate, extremely paranoid and wildly jealous of being upstaged by the 
bombing in Oklahoma City, terrorist experts and police psychologists said 
yesterday.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But the fact that the UNABOM killer set down his thoughts in a long, highly 
publicized letter may very well trip him up, crime experts said, by giving 
investigators a partial window into his mind.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Experts who analyzed the letter said it hints at a man who is not the classic 
political anarchist he claims to be and who is beginning to suffer more 
frequent episodes of emotional instability.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Paramount, however, is the suggestion that it took the tragedy of Oklahoma City 
to rouse him from his secret lair and, after 17 years of near anonymity, to 
suddenly bring forth a written 
rationale for his deadly acts.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''It's a case of explosion envy,'' said John Thompson, director of Toronto's 
Mackenzie Institute of Terrorism, Revolution and Propaganda. ''He didn't seem 
to be hungry for news coverage in the past, but perhaps now he is envying the 
coverage Oklahoma City got.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''Up until this terrible disaster in Oklahoma City, (the 
<strong>Unabomber)</strong> kind of had the field to himself,'' said San Francisco police Lieutenant Al 
Benner, who is the department psychologist. ''But Oklahoma City put him way on 
the back burner, and now he wants to assert himself.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Just one day after last week's bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma 
City, the UNABOM killer mailed three letters from Oakland, the same origin as 
the pipe bomb that arrived in Sacramento on Monday and killed timber lobbyist 
Gilbert Murray. One of the letters went to the New 
York Times, which published it in yesterday's editions. Portions also appeared 
in the The Chronicle and other papers.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the 1,300-word letter, the bomber professed anti-technology and 
pro-environmental attitudes and demanded national publication of an 
''anarchist'' manifesto in exchange for a halt to his terrorist attacks. He 
also said that ''through our bombings we hope to promote social instability in 
industrial society, propagate anti-industrial ideas and give encouragement to 
those who hate the industrial system.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">GROUP CLAIMS DOUBTED
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bomber claimed, as he did two years ago in a much shorter letter to the New 
York Times, that he was part of an anarchist group called ''FC.'' But experts 
said yesterday that they doubt he is part of any organization. Like the FBI, 
they think he has always worked alone.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">What worries some experts who analyzed the killer's letter is his 
conspiratorial notions and his unfocused ramblings on what he considers the 
world's ills. Like many conspiracy theorists, the bomber tends to focus on 
large icons of villainy, rather than specific ills.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''He's saying he hopes to promote industrial instability,'' Benner said, ''and 
you can't get any more general than that.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">At one point in the letter, the bomber said he targeted New Jersey advertising 
executive Thomas Mosser in December because Mosser's public relations firm 
''helped Exxon clean up its public image after the Exxon Valdez (oil spill).'' 
But the bomber said he was less interested in that specific event and more 
concerned with the firm's role in ''manipulating people's attitudes.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''He would have had a more cogent argument if he had stuck with the Exxon 
Valdez,'' Benner said. ''But no; he says they're brainwashing people. If you're 
dealing with manic depressives, they 
come up with a global conspiracy theory. It's the mind-set of convenience.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">EXPERIENCE WITH MENTAL HEALTH
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Another psychologist, who declined to be identified for fear of making the 
UNABOM suspect angry with her, said the letter's frequent references to applied 
psychology and behavior modification suggest that the killer may have ''had 
some experience with the mental health field, either as a patient or as a 
student. He's aware of terms that aren't something your typical high school 
graduate bomber would even be writing about.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The psychologist, who specializes in anti-social behavior, said the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> main focus is on large organizations that he fears are ''manipulating his 
attitudes.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In that focus, the bomber expresses views similar to those of some of the more 
militant militia groups now in the spotlight because of the Oklahoma City 
bombing. Both the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> and the extreme right-wing groups deride and fear the 
FBI, calling it a symbol of an overreaching, omnipotent government.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''The FBI is the favorite focus of people who have paranoid ideas,'' said the 
psychologist. ''This is very common among paranoid schizophrenics. It's very 
interesting and it's very frightening. People like this tend to suffer from a 
tremendous lack of self-esteem and have an inability to handle face-to-face 
rejection.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">By coming forward, however, the suspect is closer to apprehension.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''The more he shows himself,'' the psychologist said, ''the bigger the risk of 
being caught. Perhaps after seeing the attention this other suspect got (in 
Oklahoma City), he wants us to know that he's an important person too.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Will he get caught?
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''Oh yeah,'' said Benner, the San Francisco police psychologist. ''I'm banking 
on his ultimately tripping himself up. He'll either be caught or he'll blow 
himself up, which is poetic justice. But 
we'd prefer that he gets caught.''
