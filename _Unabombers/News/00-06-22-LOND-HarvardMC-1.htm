</p><p class="subheader" align="left"><strong>HEADLINE:</strong> A lesson in hate: In 1958, a brilliant but socially inept 15-year-old began 
his studies at Harvard. Like many of his peers, he volunteered for a number of 
personality tests in return for a small fee. Only these were no ordinary tests. 
And the student was Ted Kaczynski - now better known as the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong>

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Like many Harvard alumni, I sometimes wander the neighborhood when I return to 
Cambridge, reminiscing about the old days and musing on how different my life 
has been from what I hoped and expected then. Last fall, my return there was 
prompted not by nostalgia but by curiosity. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> I found myself a few blocks north of Harvard Yard, on Divinity Avenue. No 7 
Divinity Avenue is a modern multi-story academic building today, housing the 
university's department of molecular and cellular biology. In 1959 a 
comfortable old house stood on the site. Known as the Annex, it served as a 
laboratory in which staff members of the department of social relations 
conducted research on human subjects. There, from the fall of 1959 through the 
spring of 1962, Harvard psychologists, led by professor 
Henry A Murray, conducted a disturbing and what would now be seen as ethically 
indefensible experiment on 22 undergraduates. To preserve the anonymity of 
these student guinea pigs, experimenters referred to individuals by code name 
only. One of these students, whom they dubbed 
&quot;Lawful&quot;, was Theodore John Kaczynski, who would one day be known as the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> and who would later mail or deliver 16 package bombs to scientists, academics, 
and others over 17 years, killing three people and injuring 23.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> I first heard of the Murray experiment from Kaczynski himself. We had begun 
corresponding in July 1998, a couple of months after a federal court in 
Sacramento sentenced him to life without possibility of parole. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Kaczynski, I quickly discovered, was an indefatigable correspondent. He hinted 
darkly that the Murray Center seemed to feel it had something to hide. One of 
his defence investigators, he said, reported that the center had told 
participating psychologists not to talk with his defence team. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Through research at the Murray Center and in the Harvard archives I found 
that, among its other purposes, Henry Murray's experiment was intended to 
measure how people react under stress. Murray subjected his unwitting students, 
including Kaczynski, to intensive interrogation - what Murray himself called 
&quot;vehement, sweeping, and personally abusive&quot; attacks, assaulting his subjects' egos and most- cherished ideals and 
beliefs. My quest was specific - to determine what effects, if any, the 
experiment may have had on Kaczynski. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Kaczynski was accepted by Harvard in the spring of 1958; he was not yet 16 
years old. One friend remembers urging Kaczynski's father, Turk, not to let the 
boy go, arguing, 
&quot;He's too young, too immature, and Harvard too impersonal.&quot; But Turk wouldn't listen. 
&quot;Ted's going to Harvard was an ego trip for him,&quot; the friend recalls. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Murray, a wealthy and blue-blooded New Yorker, was both a scientist and a 
humanist. Before the war he had been the director of the Harvard Psychological 
Clinic; during it, he served in the Office of Strategic Services, the 
forerunner of the CIA, helping develop psychological screening tests for 
applicants and monitoring military experiments on brainwashing. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> After the war Murray returned to Harvard, where he continued to refine 
techniques of personality 
assessment. By 1950 he had resumed studies on Harvard undergraduates that he 
had begun, in rudimentary form, before the war, titled Multiform Assessments of 
Personality Development Among Gifted College Men. The experiment in which 
Kaczynski participated was the last and most elaborate of these. In their 
postwar form these experiments focused on stressful interpersonal relations, 
designing confrontations akin to those mock interrogations he had helped to 
orchestrate for the OSS. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Kaczynski has said that he was 
&quot;pressured into participating&quot;. His hesitation turned out to be sensible. Researchers gave the volunteers 
almost no information about the experiment in which they would participate. 
Each was simply asked to answer yes to the following question: 
&quot;Would you be willing to contribute to the solution of certain psychological 
problems (parts of an on-going program of research in the development of 
personality), by serving as a subject in a series of experiments or taking a 
number of tests (average about 2 hours a week) through the academic year (at the current College 
rate per hour)?&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> In fact it would never be clear what the 
&quot;certain psychological problems&quot; were. And the test that served as the centrepiece for this undertaking appears 
remarkably similar to the old OSS stress test. Students would be given the 
third degree. But whereas the OSS applicants must have known that enduring 
unpleasant interrogations could be part of their job, these students did not. 
The intent was to catch them by surprise, to deceive them, and to brutalise 
them. The students were led to believe that they would debate their philosophy 
of life with another student like themselves. In fact they were confronted by a 
well-prepared 
&quot;stooge&quot; - a lawyer. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> When the subject arrived, he was escorted to a 
&quot;brilliantly lighted room&quot; and seated in front of a one-way mirror. A motion-picture camera recorded his 
every move and facial 
expression through a hole in the wall. Electrodes leading to machines that 
recorded his heart and respiratory rates were attached to his body. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Forrest Robinson, the author of a biography of Murray, has described what 
happened next. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
&quot;As instructed, the unwitting subject attempted to represent and to defend his 
personal philosophy of life. Invariably, however, he was frustrated, and 
finally brought to expressions of real anger, by the withering assault of his 
older, more sophisticated opponent . . . while fluctuations in the subject's 
pulse and respiration were measured.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Not surprisingly, most participants found this highly unpleasant, even 
traumatic. 
&quot;We were led into the room with bright lights, very bright,&quot; one of them, code-named Cringle, recalled afterward. 
&quot;(I) had a sensation somewhat akin to someone being strapped on the electric 
chair with these electrodes . . . I really started getting hit real hard . . . 
Wham, wham, wham! And me get ting hotter and more irritated and 
my heartbeat going up . . . and sweating terribly . . .&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
&quot;Right away,&quot; said another, code-named Trump, describing his experience afterward, 
&quot;I didn't like (the interrogator). 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
&quot;(Dr G) . . . came waltzing over and he put on those electrodes but in that 
process, while he was doing that, kind of whistling . . . And then (Mr R) . . . 
who was bubbling over, dancing around, started to talk to me about he liked my 
suit . . . the buzzer would ring or something like that, we were supposed to 
begin . . . he was being sarcastic or pretty much of a wise guy . . . And the 
first thing that entered my mind was to get up and ask him outside immediately 
. . . but that was out of the question, because the electrodes and the movie 
and all that . . . I kind of sat there and began to fume and then he went on 
and he got my goat and I couldn't think of what to say . . . And then they came 
along and they took my electrodes off.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> During the last year of the 
experiment Murray made the students available to his graduate-student 
assistants, to serve as guinea pigs for their own research projects. By 
graduation, as Kenneth Keniston, one of these researchers, summarised the 
process later, 
&quot;each student had spent approximately 200 hours in the research, and had 
provided hundreds of pages of information about himself, his beliefs, his past 
life, his family, his college life and development, his fantasies, his hopes 
and dreams.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Why were the students willing to endure this ongoing stress and probing into 
their private lives? Some who had assisted Murray in the experiment confessed 
to me that they wondered about this themselves. But they - and we - can only 
speculate that some of the students (including Kaczynski) did it for the money, 
that some (again, probably including Kaczynski) had doubts about their own 
psychic health and were seeking reassurance about it, that some, suffering from 
Harvard's well-known anomie, were lonely and needed someone to 
talk to, and that some simply had an interest in helping to advance scientific 
knowledge. But in truth we do not know. Alden E Wessman, a former research 
associate of Murray who has long been bothered by the unethical dimension of 
this study, said to me recently, 
&quot;Later, I thought: 'We took and took and used them and what did we give them in 
return?' 
&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> What was the purpose of the experiment? Keniston told me that he wasn't sure 
what the goals were. 
&quot;Murray was not the most systematic scientist,&quot; he explained. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Murray himself gave curiously equivocal answers. Sometimes he suggested that 
his research might have no value at all. 
&quot;Cui bono?&quot; he once asked. 
&quot;As (the data) stand they are nothing but raw data, meaningless as such; and the 
question is what meaning, what intellectual news, can be extracted from them?&quot; In another context he asked, 
&quot;Are the costs in man-hours incurred by our elaborate, multiple procedures far 
greater than 
any possible gains in knowledge?&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Such equivocation prompts one to ask if the experiment could have had a 
purpose that Murray was reluctant to divulge. Was the multiform-assessments 
project intended, at least in part, to help the CIA determine how to test, or 
break down, an individual's ability to withstand interrogation? The writer 
Alexander Cockburn has asked whether the students might have been given the 
hallucinogenic drug LSD without their knowledge, possibly at the request of the 
CIA. By the late 50s, according to some, Murray had become quite interested in 
hallucinogenics, including LSD and psilocybin. And soon after Murray's 
experiments on Kaczynski and his classmates were under way, in 1960, Timothy 
Leary returned to Harvard and, with Murray's blessing, began his experiments 
with psilocybin. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> In his autobiography, Leary, who would dedicate the rest of his life to 
promoting hallucinogenic drugs, described Murray as 
&quot;the wizard of personality assessment 
who, as OSS chief psychologist, had monitored military experiments on 
brainwashing and sodium amytal interrogation. Murray expressed great interest 
in our drug-research project and offered his support.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> It is clear that Murray's experiment deeply affected at least some of its 
subjects. Even 25 years later some recalled the unpleasantness. In 1987 Cringle 
remembered the 
&quot;anger and embarrassment . . . the glass partition . . . the electrodes and 
wires running up our sleeves.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Likewise, 25 years later Drill still had 
&quot;very vivid general memories of the experience . . . I remember someone putting 
electrodes and blood pressure counter on my arm just before the filming . . . 
(I) was startled by (my interlocutor's) venom . . . I remember responding with 
unabating rage.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> And 25 years later, Locust wrote: 
&quot;I remember appearing one afternoon for a 'debate' and 
being hooked up to electrodes and sat in a chair with bright lights and being 
told a movie was being made . . . I remember him attacking me, even insulting 
me, for my values, or for opinions I had expressed in my written material . . . 
I remember being shocked by the severity of the attack, and I remember feeling 
helpless to respond . . . What is the point of this? They have deceived me, 
telling me there was going to be a discussion, when in fact there was an attack.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> We don't know what effect this experiment may have had on Kaczynski. I did not 
have access to his records, and therefore cannot attest to his degree of 
alienation then. Kaczynski must certainly have been among the most vulnerable 
of Murray's experimental subjects - a point that the researchers seem to have 
missed. He was among the youngest and the poorest of the group. He may have 
come from a dysfunctional home. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> As Kaczynski's college life continued, outwardly he seemed to be adjusting to 
Harvard. 
But inwardly he increasingly seethed. According to Sally Johnson, the forensic 
psychiatrist who examined Kaczynski, he began worrying about his health. He 
began having terrible nightmares. He started having fantasies about taking 
revenge against a society that he increasingly viewed as an evil force obsessed 
with imposing conformism through psychological controls. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> These thoughts upset Kaczynski all the more because they exposed his 
ineffectuality. Johnson reported that he would become horribly angry with 
himself because he could not express this fury openly. 
&quot;I never attempted to put any such fantasies into effect,&quot; she quoted from his writings, 
&quot;because I was too strongly conditioned . . . against any defiance of authority 
. . . I could not have committed a crime of revenge, even a relatively minor 
crime, because . . . my fear of being caught and punished was all out of 
proportion to the actual danger of being caught.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Kaczynski felt that justice demanded that he take revenge 
on society. But he lacked the personal resources at that time to do so. He was 
- had always been - a good boy. Instead he would seek escape. He began to dream 
about breaking away from society and living a primitive life. According to 
Johnson, he 
&quot;began to study information about wild edible plants&quot; and to spend time learning about the wilderness. And like many American 
intellectuals before him he began to form a plan to seek personal renewal in 
nature. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Today, society would not tolerate the deceptions inherent in the Murray 
experiments. But different standards prevailed then, and its ethics were 
definitely acceptable in their day. But the ethics of the day were wrong. And 
they framed Kaczynski's first encounter with a reckless scientific value system 
that elevated the pursuit of scientific truth above human rights. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> When, soon after, Kaczynski began to worry about the possibility of mind 
control, he was not giving vent to paranoid delusions. In view of Murray's 
experiment, he was not only rational but right. The university and the 
psychiatric establishment had been willing accomplices in an experiment that 
had treated human beings as guinea pigs, and had treated them brutally. Here is 
a powerful logical foundation for Kaczynski's latterly expressed conviction 
that academics, in particular scientists, were thoroughly compromised servants 
of 
&quot;the system&quot;, employed in the development of techniques for the behavioral control of 
populations. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> It was the confluence of two streams of development that transformed Kaczynski 
into the 
<strong>Unabomber.</strong> One stream was personal, fed by his anger toward his family and those who he 
felt had slighted or hurt him, in high school and college. The other derived 
from his philosophical critique of society and its institutions, and reflected 
the culture of despair he encountered at Harvard and later. The Murray 
experiment, containing both psychological and philosophical components, may 
well have fed both streams.

Monthly.
