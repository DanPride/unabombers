</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Looking for new leads in their search for a serial bomber who mailed the 
package that killed an advertising executive on Saturday in New Jersey, Federal 
investigators today released the name on the return address on the envelope.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Jim R. Freeman, the F.B.I. official in charge of the task force investigating 
the so-called 
<strong>Unabom</strong> case, said that the name, H. C. Wickel, was supposedly that of someone from 
the economics department at San Francisco State University here. But there is 
no evidence that such a person has ever been associated with the economics 
department or with the university either as a professor, staff member or 
student, he said.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Officials at San Francisco State said they were referring all calls relating 
to the bomb case to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The package that Thomas J. Mosser, a Young 
&amp; Rubicam executive, opened in his kitchen last Saturday was mailed on Dec. 3 
from San Francisco. F.B.I. agents believe it was mailed by the same person 
responsible for 14 other bombs over the past 16 years that killed two people 
and injured 22 others. The bomber has so far managed to avoid leaving even the 
most basic clues about his identity.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mr. Freeman, who is also the agent in charge of the San Francisco office of the 
bureau, said forensics investigators had managed to reconstruct the address, 
which he said had been typed on a mailing label affixed to the outside of the 
package containing the bomb. He would not say whether the address had been 
printed 
by a computer or a typewriter.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mr. Freeman said that Federal investigators had contacted several families in 
the Bay Area with the last name Wickel, but there did not appear to be any 
connection to the serial bomber. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Thwarted in solving the case through conventional police techniques, 
investigators appealed again today to the public for help, particularly with 
tips about the name Wickel.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The 
<strong>Unabom</strong> suspect has eluded capture for 16 years,&quot; Mr. Freeman said. 
&quot;Usually, the suspect will talk to someone and that will lead to that person 
being brought to light.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mr. Freeman also said that investigators would like to talk to anyone in the 
Bay Area who had recently mailed a package for a temporary house guest. The 
toll-free number of the 
<strong>Unabom</strong> task force hotline is (800) 701-2662.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">There have been 3,100 phone calls to the 
Federal task force since Saturday's attack. Of those 40 percent have been tips 
about individuals who look similar to the suspect in the drawing released by 
the investigators. Another 40 percent are from individuals who have theories 
about the serial bomber and 20 percent offer pieces of information about the 
case.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Today, Mr. Freeman reaffirmed the task force's belief that the bomber was a 
lone individual and not a group. Last year, in a letter to The New York Times, 
the serial bomber wrote that he was a member of an anarchist group known as 
&quot;FC.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;A group of that nature would want to get some message out to the public and 
that has not happened,&quot; Mr. Freeman said.
