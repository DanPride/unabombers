</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">HELENA, Mont. - The lawyer for suspected 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> Theodore Kaczynski demanded late yesterday that the federal government turn 
over an inventory of property seized from Kaczynski's mountain cabin, saying 
the week-long search has ended.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The U.S. attorney's office and the FBI in Helena would not confirm the claim by 
defense lawyer Michael Donahoe that the intense search ended yesterday.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">However, the FBI had withdrawn a roadblock on one of the U.S. Forest Service 
roads that leads to Kaczynski's cabin. And various members of the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> investigative squad checked out of a Helena hotel at noon yesterday.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">However, one of the roads to Kaczynski's cabin still was blocked by three men 
in an unmarked car who declined to 
<strong>identify</strong> themselves. The Forest Service road was blocked by a large barricade with a 
posted warning that the road was closed and anyone trespassing would be 
arrested.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A federal law enforcement official in Washington, insisting on anonymity, said 
he the search was ongoing despite Donahoe's claim.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Also yesterday, The Denver Post asked U.S. District Judge Charles Lovell, who 
signed the warrants for Kaczynski's arrest and search of his property, to 
unseal affidavits filed in support of the search and arrest.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Post was 
joined in the motion by The New York Times and NBC.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">John Morrison, the attorney for all three media organizations, said it was 
important that the documents be released so there would be a better 
understanding of what had transpired.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The American public has a right to know why the FBI believes Theodore Kaczynski 
is the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong>&quot; said Morrison. 
&quot;This is not a case with a large number of suspects at large who might tamper 
with evidence, 
<strong>witnesses</strong> or grand jurors or flee the jurisdiction.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;As far as we know, there is one suspect who is in custody and the premises 
(where he lived) have been secured.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Lovell late yesterday granted The Post's request for a quick hearing and set 
one for today.
