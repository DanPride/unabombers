MOUNTAIN BROOK, Ala. (AP-Reuter) - Federal agents yesterday
searched the secluded estate of a federal judge who was killed by a mail Bomb
delivered to his home. <br>
<br>
The agents said a drug-related motive is possible. <br>
<br>
<strong>Robert Vance,</strong> an 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals judge, was
killed instantly when the package exploded about 3 p.m. Saturday in the kitchen
of his luxurious Birmingham-area home, authorities said. <br>
<br>
His wife, Helen, was injured and remains in hospital in serious condition. <br>
<br>
Vance, 58, a progressive force in Alabama during 11 years as state chairman of
the Democratic party, was the third U.S. federal judge to be assassinated in
this century. <br>
<br>
Federal Bureau of Investigation spokesperson Tom Moore said there are
&quot;specific leads,&quot; but declined to elaborate, saying only that
numerous possibilities are being pursued. <br>
<br>
Some Alabama political figures suggested the bombing is linked to the Colombian
drug cartel, which has targeted judges in that country. Moore said a drug
motive &quot;is not being ruled out, but it is no more prominent than several
other avenues we are following.&quot; <br>
<br>
At many Birmingham-area churches, prayers for the recovery of Mrs. Vance were
mingled with expressions of concern over drug-related violence in North
America. <br>

Vance had not asked for protection, and the U.S. marshal's office was unaware
of any threats on his life. Asked about security for other federal judges,
Moore said: &quot;They have been warned.&quot; <br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.unabombers.com/#Stamps">Appointed to the federal appeals court in 1977 by then-president Jimmy
Carter, Vance served in a circuit that reviewed cases from Florida, Georgia and
Alabama. <br>
<br>
Judges of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals hear &quot;many appeal cases
related to drugs from Miami,&quot; said Senator Howell Heflin of Alabama, a
longtime friend of Vance's. <br>
<br>
&quot;There's speculation in that regard, but nobody knows.&quot;</a><br>
<br>
&quot;Indications are that (the <strong>bomb)</strong> was delivered by regular
U.S. mail,&quot; not special delivery, Moore said. Mrs. Vance apparently was
not standing close to her husband when explosion occurred. She was able to call
a neighbor, who summoned police. <br>
