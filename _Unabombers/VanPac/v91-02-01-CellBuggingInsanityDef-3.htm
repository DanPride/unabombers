<br>Surreptitious recordings of accused mail-bomber Walter Leroy Moody&#160;Jr. in his prison cell reveal that he is conducting rambling&#160;conversations with himself and sometimes with an imaginary person named&#160;Jim.
<br><br>Attorneys for the 48-year-old prisoner say they may use the&#160;recordings to support an insanity defense in his upcoming mail-bombing&#160;and murder trial with or without Moody's approval.
<br><br>&quot;I think talking to himself is significant, and the more significant&#160;part is him answering himself,&quot; said Edward Tolley of Athens, Moody's&#160;lead attorney.  

<br><br>Assistant U.S. Attorney Howard Shapiro got a court order to monitor&#160;Moody's conversations last July in connection with the government's mail-&#160;Bomb investigation. At the time, Moody was the prime suspect in the mail&#160;bombings, but he was being held in the Atlanta federal prison on charges&#160;of obstruction of justice and witness tampering in an unrelated case.
<br><br>Moody since has been charged in a 72-count indictment with mailing&#160;four nail-packed pipe 
bombs, two of which exploded, killing U.S. District&#160;Judge 
<strong>Robert Vance</strong> and Savannah lawyer Robert Robinson.
<br><br>Prison officials routinely monitor telephone conversations of&#160;prisoners, but they are not allowed to bug cells without a court order.&#160;Officials operating the taping equipment were given explicit instructions&#160;not to listen in on Moody's conversations 
about the obstruction of&#160;justice case that was pending against him or any defense strategy.
<br><br>Recordings of the prison-cell conversations, held under court seal,&#160;were turned over to Mr. Tolley late last year.
<br><br>But large portions of the recordings are inaudible, according to a&#160;motion Mr. Tolley filed Thursday, and he is seeking a court order for&#160;electronically 
&quot;enhanced&quot; versions of several conversations.
<br><br>Mr. Tolley said he needs the enhanced recordings to make a decision&#160;on a possible insanity defense.
<br><br>Moody's attorneys laid the groundwork for an insanity defense in his&#160;obstruction of justice trial in December in Brunswick, only to have Moody&#160;withdraw it against advice of his lawyers. He was found guilty on all&#160;charges in connection with that case even though several experts&#160;testified that Moody may suffer delusions.
<br><br>&quot;If these 
transcripts reveal delusional behavior, then insanity may&#160;well be raised as a defense again, even if over the defendant's&#160;objections,&quot; Mr. Tolley stated in court papers filed Thursday.
<br><br>Mr. Shapiro, who requested that Moody's cell be monitored, had no&#160;comment.
<br><br>Meanwhile, Moody pleaded innocent Thursday to two new charges:&#160;obstruction of justice and possession of a firearm by a felon. Moody&#160;attended the brief hearing but did not speak.
<br><br>Moody's attorney's filed 22 other motions Thursday seeking, among&#160;other things, suppression of evidence gained from searches and a change&#160;of venue.
<br><br>Mr. Tolley wants to move the case out of Georgia, Florida or Alabama&#160;because publicity about the mail 
bombs in those states would prevent&#160;Moody from having a fair trial, he said.
