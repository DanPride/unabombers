<strong>BODY:</strong><p class="subheader" align="Left"> 
<br>Birmingham - The case of convicted mail-Bomb murderer Walter Leroy&#160;Moody was to resurface today with a prosecutor looking for a death&#160;penalty, a son looking to the future, and a cleared suspect looking for&#160;an apology.
<br><br>Alabama Assistant Attorney General David Vickers was to present&#160;evidence to a Jefferson County grand jury seeking a capital murder&#160;indictment against Moody for the December 1989 mail-Bomb killing of&#160;federal appeals Judge Robert S. Vance.
<br><br><strong>Robert Vance</strong> Jr., a Birmingham lawyer, said his family is satisfied&#160;with the federal conviction earlier this year against Moody for his&#160;father's death, yet understands why state prosecutors are pursuing the&#160;case.  

<br><br>&quot;We're not really chomping at the bit to see the man get the death&#160;penalty,&quot; Mr. Vance said. 
&quot;What we really want is to get it going and&#160;over with so we can move on.&quot;
<br><br>One-time suspect Robert Wayne O'Ferrell, the south Alabama junk&#160;dealer and part-time preacher whose life was turned upside down by&#160;federal agents investigating the case, said he wants a personal apology&#160;from President Bush.
<br><br>&quot;The hurt I've had for two years will never go away until I get a&#160;public apology,&quot; Mr. O'Ferrell said. 
&quot;If they give me $ 100 million, the&#160;hurt won't go away. I didn't ask to be put on worldwide TV and be&#160;publicly humiliated.&quot;
<br><br>At today's grand jury session, Mr. Vickers said, various federal&#160;agents were to testify against Moody, who was 
sentenced to seven&#160;consecutive life terms plus 400 years in his federal trial for the mail-&#160;Bomb deaths of Judge Vance and Savannah Alderman Robert E. Robinson, a&#160;civil rights lawyer.
<br><br>&quot;Obviously, the reason we're trying him is the death penalty is at&#160;stake,&quot; said Mr. Vickers, noting that Alabama, unlike the federal&#160;government, allows the death penalty.
<br><br>Mr. Vickers said he expected Moody's ex-wife to provide key&#160;testimony against him, as she did in the federal proceeding. Georgia&#160;officials will seek to indict Moody after the Alabama trial.
<br><br>Meanwhile, Mr. O'Ferrell's attorney, Paul Hardin, said he will file&#160;a lawsuit against the federal government by Christmas. During their&#160;investigation, federal agents dug up Mr. O'Ferrell's yard and septic tank&#160;and ran roughshod over his junk business as the 
national news media&#160;watched. No evidence was found.
<br><br>Two weeks ago, Mr. O'Ferrell asked FBI agents to arrange a meeting&#160;with the president. The Secret Service was notified and planned to&#160;interview Mr. O'Ferrell to determine whether he was a threat to the&#160;president. Unexpectedly, they canceled the visit.
<br><br>&quot;They thought they were going to get caught down here in Evergreen,&#160;Ala., with the press,&quot; Mr. Hardin said. 
&quot;I think it's funny as hell. He's&#160;not a threat to the president. He just wanted an apology.&quot;
