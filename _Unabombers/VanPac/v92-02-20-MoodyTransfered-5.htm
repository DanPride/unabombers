</p><p class="subheader" align="Left">ALABAMA: Federal marshals Wednesday transferred Walter Leroy Moody to Alabama 
in preparation for his capital murder trial in the mail-Bomb death of a federal judge.
<br><br>Moody, 56, has been imprisoned at Marion, Ill., since his federal conviction in 
the bombing deaths of U.S. Appeals Court Judge 
<strong>Robert Vance</strong> of Mountain Brook and City Alderman Robert E. Robinson of Savannah, Ga.
<br><br>Moody, of Rex, Ga., is serving seven life terms plus 400 years in prison with 
no possibility of parole on the federal convictions. If convicted in Alabama on 
capital murder charges in Judge Vance's death, he could receive the death 
penalty.  

<br><br>LOUISIANA: More black judges promised. Louisiana agreed Wednesday to create 25 
black judgeships, hoping to end a 6-year-old civil rights suit. Of the state's 
more than 200 state judges, 13 are black. Eight of those are in majority black 
New Orleans. The U.S. Justice Department must approve the settlement between 
the state and black plaintiffs.
<br><br>ENNESSEE: City fined $ 200,000 for landfill violations. The state has fined 
Johnson City more than $ 200,000 for 90 violations of landfill regulations in 
six years.
<br><br>The violations were discovered at Bowser Ridge landfill during 10 inspections 
from 1984 to 1990. The Department of Environment and Conservation says solid 
waste disposal at the facility led to groundwater contamination.
<br><br>The order says Johnson City is a 
&quot;chronic violator of the Tennessee Solid Waste Disposal Act.&quot; The 
violations include failure to cover solid waste daily, control litter and 
control soil erosion.
<br><br>FLORIDA: Harassment complaints against teachers. More than a quarter of the 250 
complaints filed against Florida school teachers last year involved allegations 
of sexual harassment or misconduct, a study requested by Education Commissioner 
Betty Castor shows. It also found that a pervasive classroom bias favors boys 
and that boys are harassing girls more often at junior and senior high schools.
<br><br>MISSISSIPPI: EPA continues cleanup of Greenville site. One phase of cleanup at 
the Washington County site of a former chemical company will be completed this 
week, but federal officials say more work is needed before the property is 
safe. The primary thrust of the cleanup has been the removal of containers. 
Traces of DDT and other pesticides were 
found this week at the old Valley Chemical Co. Dead birds were found among open 
and leaking pesticide containers.
<br><br>NORTH CAROLINA: White supremacist activity rises. White supremacist activity 
reached an all-time high, and hate crimes increased in 1991 in North Carolina, 
a watchdog group said Wednesday. North Carolinians Against Racist and Religious 
Violence counted 71 incidents of hate groups trying to organize more chapters, 
a 115 percent increase over 1985. 
&quot;Racism and bigotry are now socially acceptable,&quot; said Christina Davis- McCoy, executive director of the watch-dog group. The 
report documents 58 incidents of harassment, vandalism, cross burnings, 
killings and assaults. Three national Klan groups, one neo-Nazi group and the 
Populist Party have their headquarters in the state.
