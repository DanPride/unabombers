<strong>BODY:</strong><br><br> THE FOCUS of the investigation into a string of letter-Bomb attacks in the southeastern corner of the US appeared to switch from drugs to 
race yesterday, after one 
Bomb was discovered at the Florida office of a civil rights group and another 
killed a black lawyer in Savannah, Georgia. 

<br><br> Early speculation, by the FBI and Georgia Senator Howell Heflin, had focused 
on the possibility that Colombian drug cartels might be behind the attacks. But 
the murder of Robert Robinson, a black lawyer and city councilman, and the 
attempt on the Jacksonville, Florida, office of the National Association for 
the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP) seemed to detract from that theory. 
Mr Robinson was representing the NAACP in a long running school desegregation 
case.  

<br><br>
<br><br> Mr Robinson, a 42 year-old lawyer from Savannah, Georgia, was the second 
person in three days to die from a pipe 
Bomb blast. He was opening a package while alone in his office on Monday night when 
it blew up, causing massive injuries to his chest, arms and legs. He died on 
the operating table three hours later. 

<br><br> Another 
<strong>bomb,</strong> detected before being opened at NAACP's Jacksonville headquarters yesterday 
was similar to the one which killed Mr Robinson. 

<br><br> A Federal Appeals Court Judge, 
<strong>Robert Vance,</strong> was killed when one of the 
bombs exploded at his home in Alabama on Saturday. A fourth device was discovered in 
the mail room of Atlanta's courthouse and removed harmlessly on Monday morning. 
'There's a strong similarity in the explosive devices and it appears there is 
a relationship,' said an FBI special agent, Tom Moore. Alabama, Georgia and 
Florida are all part of Judge Vance's 11th Circuit district. 

<br><br> The FBI has contacted civil rights activists around the country warning them 
to take extra precautions, particularly such high profile figures as Coretta 
Scott King, the widow of Martin Luther King. One such person contacted said the 
FBI agents were looking into the possibility that white supremacists might have 
sent the 
bombs. 

<br><br> The courthouses in Miami and Fort Lauderdale were evacuated yesterday after 
telephone threats. Parts of the Justice Department were cleared after an X-ray 
machine operator detected what he thought was a 
bomb. But the package contained a Christmas present for the Attorney General, 
Richard Thornburgh.
