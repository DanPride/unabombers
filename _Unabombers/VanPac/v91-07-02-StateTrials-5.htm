<strong>BODY:</strong><p class="subheader" align="Left"> 
<br>Alabama Attorney General Jimmy Evans said Monday that convicted mail&#160;Bomb murderer Walter Leroy Moody Jr. mounted a 
&quot;terrorist attack&quot; on the&#160;judiciary and that a capital murder prosecution is warranted.
<br><br>The only remaining question, he said, is where Moody will first face&#160;a possible death penalty prosecution - in Alabama or in Georgia. Mr.&#160;Evans said he expects to meet with federal and state prosecutors in the&#160;next few weeks to decide which state will try Moody first.
<br><br>Moody, accused of mailing package 
bombs that detonated and killed&#160;U.S. Appeals Court Judge 
<strong>Robert Vance</strong> in Mountain Brook, Ala., and civil&#160;rights lawyer Robert Robinson in Savannah, was convicted last Friday in&#160;Minnesota on non-capital federal charges stemming from the 1989 killings.
<br><br>MISSISSIPPI BLACKS 
SEEK REDISTRICTING: Mississippi blacks have asked&#160;a federal court to redraw Mississippi House and Senate district lines to&#160;increase the number of minorities who might be elected to legislative&#160;offices this fall. The Justice Department began its review Monday of the&#160;new districts submitted by the state for approval under the 1965 Voting&#160;Rights Act. Attorney Carroll Rhodes, representing the black plaintiffs,&#160;said the court has been asked to stop any elections from being held under&#160;legislative districts as they exist, or under those redrawn this spring&#160;and filed with the Justice Department.  

<br><br>HIALEAH MAYOR DENIED NEW TRIAL: A federal judge in Miami on Monday&#160;denied a new trial to Raul Martinez, the suspended mayor of Hialeah who&#160;was convicted of taking almost $ 1 million from developers in exchange for&#160;favorable zoning votes. Sentencing date was set for July 9. Martinez, 42,&#160;was convicted in March of six counts of racketeering and extortion in&#160;connection with charges he extorted almost $ 1 million in cash and&#160;property from developers while mayor. He faces up to 20 years in prison&#160;on each of six counts, for a maximum of 120 years and up to $ 1.5 million&#160;in fines. He remains free on bond until the sentencing.
<br><br>TEENS GET PROBATION IN HIGHWAY ATTACKS: Two teenage boys were&#160;sentenced Monday to one 
year's probation for firing high-powered&#160;slingshots at vehicles on Interstate 75 in Knoxville. The incidents&#160;apparently were inspired by a sniper's attacks along area highways&#160;earlier this year in which one person was killed and two were wounded.&#160;Those shootings remain unsolved. The boys, aged 15 and 16, admitted&#160;pelting the windshield of a Huntsville, Tenn., woman's car and the&#160;porthole window of a truck driven by a Rome, Ga., man on May 1. Neither&#160;driver was hurt.
<br><br>ANOTHER DENTAL PATIENT TO SUE OVER AIDS: A suburban Detroit woman&#160;plans to file suit against the estate of a Florida dentist who infected&#160;her with the AIDS virus before he died of the disease, her attorney says.&#160;Lisa Shoemaker of Birmingham, Mich., was infected through being treated&#160;by Dr. 
David Acer, who died last September. Last week she sent a letter&#160;of intent to sue Dr. Acer's estate. Tests showed that five of his&#160;patients have been infected by the AIDS virus. One patient, Kimberly&#160;Bergalis, settled for $ 1 million.
<br><br>NEW JACKSONVILLE MAYOR HAS HIGH HOPES: Ed Austin, a Florida state&#160;attorney for nearly two decades, was inaugurated Monday as mayor of&#160;Jacksonville, proclaiming the city 
&quot;a diamond in the rough.&quot; The new&#160;mayor was sworn in by Florida Supreme Court Justice Leander Shaw, who Mr.&#160;Austin hired many years ago as an assistant state attorney. Mr. Austin,&#160;who turns 65 on July 15, will receive a state pension of $ 52,827 annually&#160;in addition to his mayoral salary of $ 100,000 a 
year.; ELSEWHERE
