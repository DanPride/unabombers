      <FONT face=arial,helvetica,sans-serif>On 21 December 1988 a Pan Am Boeing 
      747 disintegrated over Lockerbie (Scotland) killing 259 people. On 19 
      September 1989 a UTA (French airlines) DC-10 exploded in mid-air killing 
      170. The trial in The Hague of two Libyans accused in the Lockerbie 
      incident has just ended in a controversial verdict. One of the accused was 
      released, the other sentenced to life imprisonment. With respect to the 
      UTA incident, the French Supreme Court of Appeal is expected to issue a 
      ruling on the request to bring proceedings against President Gadafy. 
      However, at the beginning of the investigations into the two bombings, 
      evidence initially pointed to various Palestinian groups, as well as to 
      Syria and Iran. Scientific analysis of the UTA wreckage showed that the 
      bomb technology matched that used by a Palestinian terrorist organisation. 
      <P class=spip>In summer 1990, following the outbreak of the Gulf crisis 
      and the decision by Syria and Iran to join the anti-Iraq coalition, the 
      United States, joined by the French examining magistrate, Jean-Louis 
      Bruguière, decided to abandon those leads and concentrate on Libyan 
      responsibility instead. In pursuing Libyan involvement the investigators 
      had to rely on extremely fragile testimony by a Congolese national, 
      Bernard Yanga, in Brazzaville who has links with his country's security 
      services. Following are excerpts from Pierre Péan's new book. 
      <DIV align=right>by PIERRE PÉAN *</DIV></FONT>

      <P align=justify>
      <P align=justify>Investigation insiders were well aware of the UTA case's 
      fragile nature since it hinged on the testimony of a single witness 
      (Bernard Yanga). Yanga's testimony was inconsistent with the scientific 
      evidence, which had pointed to the Arab Organisation of May 15 and thus in 
      all likelihood to Ahmed Jibril's Popular Front for the Liberation of 
      Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC) (1). Additional scientific evidence 
      was thus necessary to strengthen Yanga's accusations against Libya. 
      <P class=spip align=justify><a name="Stamps"></a>One man came rushing to the aid of Bruguière, 
      the examining magistrate: J Thomas Thurman, an FBI special agent assigned 
      to the Bureau's prestigious Explosives Unit. This unit was responsible for 
      determining the origin of bombs and explosives used in terrorist 
      incidents. Tom Thurman has worked on all the major American terrorist 
      incidents since beginning work in the police crime lab in 1981. His 
      interest in bombs, explosives and weaponry dates back to his time in 
      Korea, where he headed a weapons factory. Thurman is not the kind of man 
      to waste his time behind a microscope, and many of his colleagues have 
      been bitterly critical of this. <a href="http://www.unabombers.com/#Stamps2">One of them, Dr Frederic Whitehurst of the 
      FBI's Scientific Analysis Section (SAS), complained in a memo to his 
      superiors that Thurman had fabricated evidence in order to prove the guilt 
      of Walter Leroy Moody (an American "serial bomber") while working on 
      another case being investigated concurrently with the Lockerbie bombing 
      incident.</a> &#8230; Thurman's misbehaviour was substantiated in several other 
      cases and resulted in his suspension from the FBI in 1997 (2). 
      <P class=spip align=justify>Thurman always tried to arrive quickly at 
      bombing sites and, much like a bloodhound, begin his search for evidence. 
      Two days after the Pan Am 747 went down over Lockerbie, he was bustling 
      about the wreckage, making contacts with both the Scottish police and his 
      CIA counterparts. It is worth repeating how he masterfully solved the 
      Lockerbie case by providing "scientific" evidence of the involvement of 
      Libya and two Libyan nationals, even though the evidence had been pointing 
      to Iranian and Syrian complicity via the PFLP-GC. The Americans saw a real 
      go-getter in action, high on the adrenalin rush he felt during his 
      dramatic investigations. "You can't sleep," said the new Superman. "We're 
      the blacksmiths of the FBI. The nuts and bolts. We get extremely dirty, 
      actually, filthy dirty." 
      <P class=spip align=justify>Thurman's approach is anything but scientific. 
      He manufactures opinions or hears them on the grapevine, and then tries to 
      "prove" them scientifically. Working alongside his CIA colleagues on the 
      Lockerbie and UTA bombings, he was aware that the CIA suspected Libyan 
      involvement in both cases despite the evidence pointing to the PFLP-GC. 
<B>
      <P class=spip align=justify>Help from the CIA </B>
      <P class=spip align=justify>The CIA provided Thurman with information 
      concerning three cases that showed unmistakable signs of Libyan 
      involvement: 
      <P class=spip align=justify>On Saturday 10 March 1984, at 12.35 pm, a UTA 
      DC-8 operating as flight 772 connecting Brazzaville, Bangui, N'Djamena and 
      Paris exploded at the N'Djamena airport in Chad. &#8230; Twenty-five people were 
      injured, one of whom died several months later. This incident came on the 
      heels of a statement by Gadafy in which he wondered if the French "were 
      ready to wage another Algerian war in Chad". Libya decided to harass 
      France, which sent 3,000 soldiers to Chad as part of Operation Manta. 
      Libya wanted to demonstrate that despite the French military presence, 
      security could not be assured in a sensitive location like an airport, 
      located more than 1,500 km from the "red line" on Chad's 16<SUP>th</SUP> 
      parallel. The French intelligence services concluded that Libyan 
      involvement was "very probable". The suitcase containing the explosives 
      was most likely loaded onto the aircraft in Bangui (Central African 
      Republic), checked in under the fictitious name of Saïd Youris. In 
      reality, Youris was one Al Masri, who had been observed in March 1985 in 
      Cotonou (Benin) working within the highly active Libyan People's Bureau. 
      The French foreign intelligence service, the General Directorate for 
      External Security (GDES), conveyed its findings to the CIA. 
      <P class=spip align=justify>The CIA also supplied Thurman with information 
      concerning the attempted bombing of the United States embassy in Togo; the 
      Togolese security services had arrested nine people and discovered two 
      suitcases packed with plastic explosives. 
      <P class=spip align=justify>Most significantly, Thurman was given access 
      to a special CIA dossier that the Americans used to direct the Congolese 
      military security forces toward the trail leading to Libya. This case 
      pertains to the 20 February 1988 arrest at Dakar airport of two Libyans, 
      Mohammed Marzouk, alias Mohammed Naydi, and Mansour Omran Saber. The men 
      were in possession of two MST-13 timers, part of an order that Libya had 
      placed with the Swiss firm Mebo AG. They were also carrying Semtex and 
      nine kilos of plastic explosives. The men spent four months in prison and 
      were then released. 
      <P class=spip align=justify>A year and a half into the Pan Am 
      investigation, Thurman "discovered" a fingernail-sized fragment of printed 
      circuit board that had allegedly triggered the explosion of the suitcase 
      bomb. In mid-June 1990 a fact-finding commission showed a photograph of 
      the fragment to Edwin Bollier, the head of Mebo. According to Bollier, the 
      fragment he identified could have come from an order Mebo had sold to the 
      Libyan secret service; but Bollier was not able to physically examine the 
      fragment itself. It was only in September 1999 during the Lockerbie trial 
      in Scotland that he was able to inspect two fragments of the infamous 
      timer using a microscope. Bollier and his adviser reached the following 
      conclusions: the fragments did not come from the timer that had been sold 
      to the Libyans; the timer fragments had not been connected electrically 
      (ie they had not been used); and most importantly, the fragments were not 
      the same as those in the photo he had been shown in 1990! In May last year 
      a Scottish judge asked Bollier to examine a fragment from the same timer: 
      this time the fragment was charred! 
      <P class=spip align=justify>Bollier has proclaimed far and wide, including 
      on his company's website (3), that the fragments the Scottish judge showed 
      him had been tampered with; some form of manipulation had thus taken 
      place. "It's a forgery created by the FBI to support the theory 
      implicating Libya. What I saw could not have come from Mebo" (4). It may 
      be wise to keep one's distance from a man who has never been particularly 
      selective about who he sells to, and who has apparently continued selling 
      timers to Libya even after finding out that they were being used for 
      terrorist purposes. Indeed, Bollier - who also supplied the Stasi, the 
      former East German intelligence service - has changed his initial version 
      of events somewhat. Nevertheless, it is useful to bear his testimony in 
      mind (and to ascertain the nature of his relations with the CIA as well) 
      in order to understand the account of the timer that allegedly detonated 
      the suitcase on board the UTA flight. <B>
      <P class=spip align=justify>Shifting the ground to Libya </B>
      <P class=spip align=justify>In early summer 1990 Bruguière was studying 
      the possible role of the PFLP-GC and certain Shiite Muslim groups - thus 
      suggesting Syrian and Iranian involvement - when the Congolese report 
      implicating Libya was issued. This shift in focus occurred at the same as 
      it had in the Lockerbie investigation, and US influence was immediately 
      suspected. Moreover, Bruguière and the Americans were both aware of the 
      fragile nature of the testimony of the sole witness, Bernard Yanga&#8230; 
      <P class=spip align=justify>Thurman had been working on photos of all the 
      UTA wreckage found in a 50 sq km area of the Tenere Desert; this evidence 
      was placed under special judicial seal no. 4. Unbeknownst to Bruguière and 
      Claude Calisti, an expert from the Prefecture of Police crime lab, in 
      summer 1991 Thurman identified a small piece of printed circuit board, 
      green in colour and measuring 4 sq cm, bearing the marking TY. 
      <P class=spip align=justify>Without notifying the French authorities, the 
      FBI detectives began following the TY trail. TY is the trademark of the 
      Taiwanese firm Taiyoun, which manufactured 120,000 such timers in 1988, of 
      which 20,000 were for the German firm Grässlin, based in Freiburg. The FBI 
      then pored over Grässlin's client list of some 350 names before singling 
      one of them: Hans Peter Wüst, a German national who had travelled to Libya 
      in November 1988 and met with Issa al-Shibani. Al-Shibani had asked if 
      Wüst could provide him with timers that could run on direct current using 
      a nine or 12 volt power supply and which were intended for the night-time 
      illumination of airfields in the desert. 
      <P class=spip align=justify>Upon returning to Germany, Wüst contacted the 
      Steinmetz company about modifying the batteries, which were not 
      sufficiently powerful, and this was arranged. Wüst told the FBI that he 
      delivered the timers to Tripoli on 20 July 1989. The FBI quickly concluded 
      that Libya had indeed purchased the TY timer, which had served as the 
      retarding agent in the Samsonite luggage on board the DC-10. Thurman thus 
      discovered the scientific evidence implicating Libya in both the Lockerbie 
      and Tenere incidents. 
      <P class=spip align=justify>Before informing Bruguière, the Americans 
      began seeking British and French participation in an anti-Gadafy 
      initiative, which led to the Libyan embargo. Immediately after receiving 
      Thurman's report on 15 October 1991, Calisti notified Bruguière, who was 
      pleased to have formal evidence supporting Yanga's testimony and 
      scientifically proving the Libyan connection. "Formal proof of Libyan 
      culpability" was supplied by the FBI, which worked on the top-secret 
      photographs of the tiny piece of circuit board used to detonate the 
      suitcase bomb, as Jean-Marie Pontault passionately proclaimed on both 
      <I>Le Point</I>'s front page and in his book (5). Neither Bruguière nor 
      Pontault is worried by the belated yet timely arrival of this evidence, 
      more than two years after the bombing. 
      <P class=spip align=justify>Bruguière's bill of indictment includes the 
      FBI's findings in their entirety but makes no mention of the French 
      specialists' objections to these conclusions. Thurman's assertions, 
      however, have spurred two counter-inquiries, one by the French 6th Central 
      Criminal Investigation Directorate (CCID) and the French Territorial 
      Surveillance Directorate (TSD), and the other by the Prefecture of Police 
      crime lab. <B>
      <P class=spip align=justify>Findings of the crime lab </B>
      <P class=spip align=justify>The latter's conclusions are definitive: "It 
      cannot be established that our timer fragment came from either the first 
      batch purchased by the Freiburg factory or the second batch modified by 
      the Libyan." A French interior ministry internal memorandum, dated 10 
      March 1993, is equally categorical: "The investigations pertaining to the 
      fragment of printed circuit board found in the wreckage of the DC-10 and 
      which may have come from the timer that caused the explosion have been 
      completed. These investigations, conducted in 1992 in both Taiwan and 
      Germany, have not enabled us to determine that the fragment came from the 
      shipment of 101 timers ordered by the Libyan Issa al-Shibani." 
      <P class=spip align=justify>Nor does Bruguière mention the Prefecture of 
      Police crime lab's counter-inquiry, conducted in spring 1993 under 
      Calisti's direction after the FBI investigation had been completed. 
      Following the release of Thurman's report, the circuit board fragment - 
      the "evidence" - had been removed from judicial seal no. 4, under which 
      all the debris had been gathered, placed under special seal no. 4/4 and 
      then examined thoroughly. Calisti, considered one of the world's leading 
      explosives experts, offered this conclusion: the fragment provided by the 
      FBI may have come from a timer similar to the one the FBI presented to 
      Bruguière (ie the same timer purchased by Libya), but in no way could the 
      fragment have come from the timer used to detonate the suitcase bomb. 
      Calisti and his team found no trace of explosives on the timer fragment. 
      <P class=spip align=justify>How could the bomb's retarding agent show no 
      molecular trace of its exposure to penthrite during an explosion of such 
      magnitude? Using complicated methods, the FBI tried to allay the doubts of 
      its French counterparts by demonstrating that other areas close to the 
      bomb showed no trace of explosives; according to the FBI, the deformations 
      on the circuit board fragment were unquestionably due to the blast effect! 
      <P class=spip align=justify>According to Calisti, the timer fragment did 
      not constitute scientific evidence of Libyan involvement; his familiarity 
      with Abu Ibrahim's bomb-making techniques also helped him arrive at this 
      conclusion. Indeed, the TY timer could not have fit in the suitcase bomb 
      because the timer was much too large. The Prefecture of Police crime lab 
      thus stuck to its guns. Despite his certainty, Calisti had the debris 
      under judicial seal no. 4 examined under a microscope in the hopes of 
      finding another circuit board fragment on which the blast effect could be 
      observed; this important test also proved unsuccessful. It is striking to 
      note the similarity of the "scientific" evidence discovered by the FBI in 
      both the Lockerbie and UTA cases. Of the tens of thousands of pieces of 
      debris collected at each disaster site, one lone piece of printed circuit 
      was found and, miracle of miracles, in each case the fragment bore 
      markings that allowed for positive identification: Mebo in the Lockerbie 
      case and TY in the case of the UTA DC-10. &#8230; 
      <P class=spip align=justify>Despite the common findings of the CCID, the 
      TSD and the Prefecture of Police crime lab, Bruguière chose to believe 
      Thurman, the expert in fabricating evidence &#8230; <B>
      <P class=spip align=justify>The suitcase story </B>
      <P class=spip align=justify>Given that the initial scientific evidence - 
      the suitcase bomb - had led the investigation to focus on Ahmed Jibril and 
      the Arab Organisation of 15 May, and given that the timer fragment itself 
      was unpersuasive, Bruguière resorted to incredible contortions to 
      establish a link between the suitcase and Libya. 
      <P class=spip align=justify>Bruguière explains in his bill of indictment 
      that in September 1992 the TSD was informed that the Libyans were keeping 
      two suitcase bombs in a non-judicial location, with one of them being of 
      potential interest to the inquiry already underway. According to the 
      Libyans, the two suitcases had been recovered at the time of bombing 
      incidents carried out by the Libyan opposition on Libyan soil. Shielding 
      himself behind the TSD, the judge saw the incidents as nothing but a 
      "Libyan manoeuvre" designed "to sidetrack the French investigators". The 
      judge then used the so-called manoeuvre to indict the Libyans. 
      <P class=spip align=justify>One of the two Samsonite 200 wheeled suitcases 
      was similar in appearance to the one that had brought down the UTA flight. 
      In his bill of indictment, Bruguière stated that "the TSD's deputy 
      director, who examined the suitcase in Tripoli, noted that in all 
      probability it had been stored somewhat carelessly since it was quite 
      dusty. In addition, there was no indication that the suitcase had been 
      under any form of judicial seal. According to accounts, the suitcase was 
      reportedly retrieved in 1987 in Tripoli in the possession of an opponent 
      of Gadafy's regime who had links to the Mugarief network, the primary 
      opponents of the Libyan government. The DST's deputy director then spoke 
      with Abdallah Senoussi, head of the Libyan intelligence services. Under 
      pressure from the French official, Senoussi suddenly agreed to have the 
      two suitcases brought up to his Tripoli office. The Libyans would go on to 
      regret this imprudent act." 
      <P class=spip align=justify>This account is quite simply false. It was in 
      Tripoli on Friday 15 November 1991 (not September 1992) that Senoussi 
      first mentioned the existence of the suitcase to General Philippe Rondot, 
      Pierre Joxe's intelligence adviser. In the belief that he was offering 
      definitive proof of his good faith, the Libyan showed the general the 
      suitcase bomb, which was identical to the one used on board the UTA DC-10. 
      Rondot was able to take samples of the explosives in the suitcase, and a 
      Libyan foreign intelligence official gave him the following account: "We 
      found this suitcase in the possession of a Tunisian member of the Mugarief 
      group. As you may know, Mugarief has long had a base in Baghdad, where he 
      provided assistance to Hissene Habre's regime in Chad, supplying it with 
      arms seized by Iraq after the Iran-Iraq war. Mugarief was part of Colonel 
      Haftar's forces, which were set up and financed by the CIA in Chad, and 
      which disappeared without a trace with CIA help following Idriss Deby's 
      overthrow of Habre. And as you may know, Mugarief is currently in the 
      United States." 
      <P class=spip align=justify>Another TSD delegation arrived in Tripoli in 
      April 1992 to investigate the suitcase story and other matters. On 24 
      September 1992 Bruguière met secretly with the Libyan Judge Mursi at the 
      French consulate in Geneva, where Bruguière examined photographs of the 
      suitcases and retained possession of the photos. Many more secret meetings 
      took place before the suitcases arrived in France. What the Libyans had 
      taken to be proof of their good faith had been transformed by the French 
      examining magistrate into the key evidence of their guilt. Starting from 
      the presumption that Libyans are inveterate liars, Bruguière concluded 
      that Libya was in possession of suitcase bombs manufactured by Abu Ibrahim 
      and that the suitcase used to blow up the UTA DC-10 came from Tripoli. 
      However, in his bill of indictment, the judge forgot one "detail": the 
      system used to detonate the suitcase recovered by the Libyans was not the 
      same as the one that, according to the FBI, blew up the Samsonite suitcase 
      on board the aircraft in Brazzaville. This detail only served to bolster 
      the arguments of the French experts under Calisti's direction. In short, 
      the suitcase debris and timer fragments found in the Tenere Desert could 
      in no way constitute proof of Libyan involvement in the bombing. <B>
      <P class=spip align=justify>The scourge of terrorists </B>
      <P class=spip align=justify>As one of the first French judicial 
      celebrities, Bruguière has spent long hours polishing his image and 
      setting the stage for his investigations and travels. Realising that he 
      could single-handedly reshape French foreign policy and recognising that 
      politicians were scared of him, Bruguière organised and perfected a 
      powerful system that enabled him to lobby for and impose his own view of 
      the truth. Judges are the last remaining professionals to enjoy flattering 
      coverage in an otherwise ruthless press since they can grant scoops to 
      whomever they like due to the confidentiality of judicial proceedings. Woe 
      unto those who fail to return the favour. Bruguière was one of the first 
      to learn this trick. The DC-10 bombing case put him on the magazines' 
      front pages for the first time. The French weekly <I>Le Point</I> offers 
      justification for this in an article that must have made his head spin: 
      "This judge is on our cover because he represents all that we cherish as 
      opposed to all that we hate. A love for justice as opposed to compulsory 
      moral compromise; civic courage as opposed to systematic equivocation; the 
      rule of law as opposed to the collusive reasons of state. He is a soldier 
      fighting terrorism, that war waged by cowards. He combats the 
      investigative sloth recommended by our chronic 'realists' in order to 
      ensure their own peace of mind and that of a jaded state. 
      <P class=spip align=justify>"Bruguière is one of the last to serve this 
      unworthy old crone that our democracy is becoming. He is a soldier of 
      justice. He is not a braggart. He has no sponsors, and has nothing to sell 
      or advertise save a personal conception of the law that brings honour to 
      all civilised nations. I recognise that his is not the image likely to be 
      exhibited in the court of public opinion, but this is all the more reason 
      to do so&#8230;" 
      <P class=spip align=justify>The reality is otherwise. Bruguière has always 
      felt closer to the Place Beauvau (ministry of the interior) than to the 
      Place Vendôme (ministry of justice), especially when Charles Pasqua and 
      Jean-Louis Debré were in power. He remained on good terms with Alain 
      Marsaud after Marsaud resigned his position on the 14<SUP>th</SUP> 
      antiterrorist court to join Charles Pasqua in the Senate. His close links 
      to the Rally for the Republic have led him to dream of occupying positions 
      such as the directorship of the TSD or of the Gendarmerie, since this 
      "soldier of justice" also has secret agent yearnings. Nothing thrilled him 
      more than arranging, in collaboration with General Rondot, the 1994 
      capture of Carlos in the Sudan. As a man of order and a believer in 
      "reasons of state", Bruguière sees himself on the front lines of the fight 
      to preserve certain values. He disdains those human rights defenders who 
      "play into terrorists' hands". &#8230; 
      <P class=spip align=justify>In 1981 the French State Security Court, which 
      had dealt with terrorist cases, ceased to exist. Bruguière was then 
      entrusted with a bombing case involving the Direct Action group. This 
      proved a turning point in his career. He gave up his work on organised 
      crime and began to concentrate on terrorism-related matters. Eighty of his 
      100 cases in 1986 pertained to terrorism. Bruguière became the uncontested 
      expert in cases that had badly shaken public opinion - so much so that 
      journalists dubbed him the terrorists' "hunter" and "nemesis". &#8230; 
      <P class=spip align=justify>Bruguière's methods, often seen as 
      expeditious, make him stand out among judges. He has increased the number 
      of commissions of enquiry, examinations, interrogations, temporary 
      detentions and instances of political provocation. Certain prominent cases 
      that initially seemed open-and-shut turned out to be without substance or 
      were poorly conceived. In January 1999 the French court of criminal appeal 
      dismissed the case of the Saint-Germain-des-Prés drugstore bombing 
      involving Carlos the Jackal, ruling that there were no grounds for 
      prosecution. The tribunal's judgement with respect to the vast so-called 
      Chalabi network - 173 Islamic activists who, on Bruguière's orders and in 
      connivance with Jean-Louis Debré, were rounded up with great ceremony - 
      was a stinging rebuff to Bruguière's efforts. Thirty-four of those 
      detained were released for lack of evidence on the orders of Judge Thiel, 
      who took over the case; of the 138 individuals tried in a Fleury-Mérogis 
      gymnasium, 51 were released after spending several months in pre-trial 
      detention&#8230; 
      <P class=spip align=justify>The administration of French antiterrorist 
      justice under Bruguière's heavy hand is now being challenged. Bruguière's 
      judicial efforts have eluded any form of democratic control since 
      antiterrorist matters are his purview and he has been entrenched since 
      1986. He is accountable to no one, and thanks to his made-to-measure 
      position as first vice-president of the Paris tribunal, he enjoys a 
      semi-regal status worthy of France's <I>ancien régime.</I> In the opinion 
      of most lawyers, the French court of criminal appeal, which should serve 
      as a genuine recourse as regards the decisions of antiterrorist judges, 
      now operates like a simple record-keeping chamber: owing to the cases' 
      size and complexity, the judges cover up without asking questions. </FONT>
