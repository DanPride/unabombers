<p class="detail">To me this is one of the most interesting things to turn up in this very 
weird case. Detective Gardner is obviously a very bright alert perceptive 
officer with an exact recall of events ...who what where and when. The kinda guy 
you hope they would put on your case if somebody bumped you off. </p>
<p class="detail">But But But...the only thing he can't really recall with crystal 
and impressive clarity is the reason they did not pursue the most obvious 
suspect. He remembers who was manning the camera ...but not so clear on why its 
result is discarded without pursuit. </p>
<p class="detail">The lingering doubts and dissatisfactions of an honest man who is feeling 
puzzled about it all still is what I hear.</p>
<p class="detail">In the summer of 1993, when my handwriting was the most important clue known 
to me, 
I went to great lengths to make it calligraphically different using a methodical 
block print rather than script. I have no 
conclusive idea why. I was not aware of any outside influence and was not yet 
aware of my own involvement. The change was motivated by an inappropriate emotional 
response to my own handwriting which is of course illogical but nevertheless 
quite effective. Re-learning writing at 40 is quite a task involving substantial 
effort toward the goal. I printed for five more years ...even after I figured it 
out (when my Polson banker asked me about it in 1998). How would you derail a 
dedicated Detective from going after his prime suspect after walking through Gil Murray's guts all morning with the 
secretaries hysteria playing in his ears. Are the ample rumors of attitudinal 
Mind Control capabilities true ?&nbsp; Can &quot;they&quot; really 
make a judges blood boil every time he looks at the defendant? I don't know. I 
only <b>know</b> that at age 42 I was suddenly overtaken by a strong negative emotional 
reaction to my own handwriting, ...at a very conspicuous time...1 month after 
the <a href="NathanRNote.htm">Nathan R note is found</a> and three months before 
it is released in the New York Times on Oct 7 1993. I predict that if the conspiracy 
rumors are true and a real capability does exist,&nbsp; Democracy, Justice, 
Truth, the American Way, and the goodness of the American people itself will be
 swamped in its tide of pure unadulterated power.</p>
 
<p class="detail">Was it him ? I don't know. I never got a definitive answer. But I will 
probably keep at this until I do :)</p>
