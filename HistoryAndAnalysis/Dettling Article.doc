RAY DETTLING                                   [Image]Over the last century, the maximum speed at which we can transport ourselveshas increased a thousand-fold. The invention of the steam and internalcombustion engines allowed us to reach speeds of 100 miles per hour by theturn of the last century. The advent of air transport brought us to severalhundred miles per hour, and before long we came up against what seemed to bean insurmountable obstacle the so-called sound barrier, the speed at whichsound waves propagate through air, or about 740 miles per hour in air at sealevel.To many of the early test pilots, the sound barrier was more than just acolorful expression. Because of the extreme turbulence encountered near thespeed of sound, the sound barrier was often thought to be a true physicalspeed limit until the American test pilot, Chuck Yeager, proved them wrongby successfully flying the experimental Bell X-1 rocket plane through thesound barrier and paving the way for supersonic transport.Today astronauts routinely orbit the earth at 17,000 miles per hour, whileother spacecraft carry scientific payloads through the solar system atspeeds up to 150,000 miles per hour. In empty space, however, there is nosound barrier to cross no material substance to become an obstacle. In fact,there seems to be nothing to prevent us from moving as fast as we want. Notquite. It turns out that space itself comes with a built-in speed limit.In 1905, a young scientist working as a clerk in the Swiss patent officewrote down a handful of equations that would soon be heralded as one ofhumanity's greatest intellectual triumphs. Its far-reaching implicationsshattered the classical "common sense" model of the physical universe andintroduced a radically new, paradoxical description of space, time, andreality itself. The clerk's name was Albert Einstein, and his equationsbecome known as the Special Theory of Relativity.This theory defined the laws of motion for all objects moving at a constantvelocity. It also made the bold assumption that every measurement of thespeed of light would have the same result, approximately 186,000 miles persecond, whether it was taken from a stationary or moving point with respectto the light source. This implied there was no absolute frame of referencein the universe upon which all measurements of motion could be based. Itfurther implied that space and time had to be intimately linked such thatall the material in the universe, from the smallest particle to the largestgalaxy, no longer existed in space alone, but in a vast sea of space-time.This enlightened view of reality also led to the inescapable conclusion thatthe speed of light would have to be nature's ultimate speed limit. Itpertained not just to the movement of material objects, but to energy andinformation as well. While it was impossible to travel faster than light, itwas also impossible to send messages faster than light.Unlike yesterday's so-called "impassible" sound barrier, which had noscientific basis, the light barrier appeared to be inextricably tied toreality. After holding up against numerous tests throughout this century,the speed-of-light limit has now become a major cornerstone of modernphysics. But within the framework of relativity, there are still someloopholes that may let us break or at least bypass the light barrier.But why would anyone need to move faster than light? While our fastestmanned spacecraft took three days to complete its round trip to the Moon, abeam of light would make the same trip in less than three seconds. Indeed,it appears that nature has been overly generous in establishing her speedlimit. It is hard to imagine the need, let alone the means, for pushinganything to superluminal speeds.In fact, there are practical reasons for breaking the light barrier. In somesituations, light is just not fast enough. The best example comes from thecomputer industry. Even though electrical signals move at the speed oflight, they still require about a billionth of a second to cover a distanceof one foot through the computer's circuitry. Consequently, the lengths ofthe conductive elements within high-speed computers have become an importantdesign consideration in determining a computer's speed and performance.Also, as we communicate over greater and greater distances, we are becominggrudgingly aware of another problem brought on by the light barrier. Evennow, anyone engaged in a two-way telephone conversation through one of ourcommunication satellites must wait about a half-second for each response. Ifthe other party were on the Moon, we would have to wait nearly three secondsfor each response. In the case of Mars, however, normal conversation becomesvirtually impossible since we need to allow anywhere from six to fortyminutes for each response, depending on the distance between Earth and Marsat the time of the conversation.This can create a serious problem if, for example, we are trying to guide arobot vehicle on the surface of Mars from a control center on Earth. By thetime a radio transmission from the Martian probe alerted us that our robotvehicle was heading straight toward a large fissure, it would be too late todo anything. The vehicle would already be a pile of rubble at the bottom ofthe Martian rift.The same problems must be dealt with in guiding our deep space probes. NASAhas directed much of its resources toward developing autonomous spacecraftand artificial intelligence systems to handle these problems. NASA needsmachines that can take care of themselves since the light barrier placesthem out of our reach.Although today's engineers have only been inconvenienced by the lightbarrier, tomorrow's dreamers of star travel may be shut down completely.Light is far too slow. It takes a beam of light four years to reach theclosest star and 100,000 years to cross our galaxy. If we ever hope totransport ourselves across such great distances, we will need to get aroundthe light barrier.Yet no one expects to see any serious efforts directed toward cracking thelight barrier. Any such proposal at the present time falls into the samecategory as building a time machine. The comparison is a good one becausefaster-than-light speeds and time travel are intimately related. Accordingto relativity theory, the faster one moves in space, the slower one moves intime. Before we can really get serious about breaking the light barrier, wewill first need to improve our understanding of space-time. And that willrequire a much deeper understanding of all the implications of the Theory ofRelativity.If we can't send information faster than light, how can we hope to movephysical objects at superluminal speeds? First, look at the strange effectspredicted by the Theory of Relativity as we move closer to the speed oflight. To an outside observer, the moving object will appear progressivelyshorter in the direction of its motion. Also, while its length is shrinking,its mass is increasing. If it ever reaches the speed of light, its lengthwill have contracted to nothing and its mass become infinite. We are leftwith something of zero size that weighs more than the entire universe. Asstrange as these effects are, they have been verified experimentally forspeeds close to the speed of light and in themselves seem to prove thatbreaking the light barrier will always be impossible.But still another effect takes place. Time slows down for everything onboard the moving object. Not only do all clocks run slower, all biologicalprocesses including aging also slow down accordingly. At the speed of light,time stops altogether. If we could move faster than light, we would travelbackward in time, which opens up all sorts of paradoxical questions aboutcausality. Similarly, if we transmitted information between a sender and areceiver at superluminal speeds, we would be able to communicate with thepast. We could in fact receive messages before they were sent. Thus thelight barrier seems even more impervious. Yet nature is full of loopholes.At less than lightspeed the time dilation effect, in one sense, does allowus to get around the light barrier. For example, if we embark on a trip at98-percent lightspeed to another star that is 25 light years away (meaning abeam of light takes 25 five years to reach that star), we will arrive at ourdestination in only five years according to our own clock. According tomeasurements made on Earth, a beam of light will take 25 years to make thesame trip. Thus from this somewhat jaundiced perspective, we made the tripat five times the speed of light. After taking another five years for thereturn trip, we will find upon our arrival that 51 years have passed onEarth while only 10 years have passed for those aboard the ship. This effecthas been verified in particle accelerators where half-lives of short-livedparticles have increased many fold while moving near the speed of light.A closer look at the mathematics embodied in the Theory of Relativityreveals that the theory does not actually rule out faster-than-light travel.It simply restricts material objects from traveling at the speed of light.Thinking along these lines, Columbia physicist Gerald Feinberg suggestedthat there may exist on the other side of the light barrier a special familyof particles he calls tachyons, which always travel faster than light.Tachyons would be governed by the same laws of physics that govern ourslower-than-light world. However, they would exhibit some remarkableproperties, traveling backward in time and moving faster as they loseenergy. At their lowest energy, they would move at nearly infinite speed andcould tour the whole universe within seconds.Some physicists have speculated that a complete tachyon universe may existacross the light barrier. If so, perhaps it may be possible to apply certainprinciples from quantum physics that would allow us, once we get near thespeed of light, to "tunnel through" the light barrier into the tachyonuniverse where we could zip through space-time at superluminal speeds, thentunnel back to our own universe at any location we desire. If this soundsfar-fetched, consider that today's electronic industry is full of devices,such as tunnel diodes, that change their energy state from one level toanother without ever experiencing an intermediate value. That would be likedriving 50 miles per hour and then suddenly jumping to 60 miles per hourwithout ever crossing the 55 mile-per-hour speed limit. No matter how crazythis sounds, it is exactly the way things operate in the subatomic world,and once we gain a clearer understanding of the principles of quantumphysics that regulate these processes, we may learn to apply them on a muchlarger scale maybe even to spaceships.Indeed, if we could shrink to a size much smaller than an atom and lookabout, we would discover the Alice-in-Wonderland world of quantum physics,where particles instantly vanish and then reappear somewhere else or out ofnothing, materialize as different particles altogether, or suddenly changefrom one energy level to another for no apparent reason. Inside this chaoticmicroworld, where randomness rules and causality and logic are meaningless,there may lie many important clues, perhaps even the key, that will take usbeyond the light barrier. In fact, for some time physicists have been awareof (not to mention troubled by) certain quantum processes that alwaysinvolve faster-than-light signals. These effects are found when a subatomicprocess releases two particles that remain bonded by a kind of "quantumpartnership agreement," wherein the state of one particle must alwayscompliment the state of the other so as to comply with the known laws ofquantum physics. What is most intriguing about this bond is that it isforever locked, so that whenever we disturb one particle, the other willfeel the effect and respond appropriately at exactly the same time, whetherthe particles are separated by a few inches or millions of miles.Physicists, including Einstein, have proposed several esoteric experimentsto test the prospect of communicating faster than light. Several theorieswere developed that to some extent have reconciled the conflict between thisfaster-than-light "quantum connection" and the requirements of therelativity theory by demonstrating that none of these schemes would work asa means for two-way communication. Nevertheless, the book is still open onthis, and arguments from both sides continue. We will have to wait for thefinal answer.Turning away from the realm of quantum physics, we find other possibilitiesby looking at the large-scale structure of the universe and the nature ofspace-time itself. About 20 billion years ago, from a single point out ofnowhere, a tiny bubble of space-time appeared and, driven by theunimaginable pressure of all the matter and energy in the universe, flaredout in a superluminal expansion carving out the present-day universe. Underthese extreme conditions, the flow of matter and energy can carry away thevery essence of space-time. The opposite is also true: matter can be carriedoff by the motion of space-time.This suggests another way around the light barrier. If we could find orcreate conditions extreme enough to disturb the local space-time in anappropriate way, we should be able to push objects up to superluminalspeeds. This approach does not violate relativity conditions since themoving objects are still going slower than the speed of light within theirvicinity. Just as a man walking inside a moving train will pass by objectson the ground much faster than a man walking outside at the same rate, sodoes the spacecraft caught in a moving stream of space-time.But do these space-time streams exist? Current theory says yes. They shouldbe found in the vicinity of rotating black holes. Black holes are theremains of large stars that have used up all their fuel and collapsed undertheir enormous gravitational pressure to an infinitely small point, leavingbehind a gravitational scar in space-time. A rotating black hole actuallydrags with it the space-time in its region, much like a spinning baseballdrags the air near its surface. Unfortunately, these space-time streamsrapidly drop off as we move away from the black hole. Other theories,however, predict the existence of superdense strings that play a role in theformation of galaxies. If these exist, perhaps some very advancedcivilizations already ride their accompanying space-time streams around thegalaxy much like today's aircraft ride the jetstreams.There may still be other ways to beat the system. Instead of trying toexceed the speed of light, maybe we can find a shortcut, take our time, andstill get to our destination first. These shortcuts are conceptuallypossible when space-time is structured around more than three dimensionssuch that what seems a straight line between two points from ourthree-dimensional perspective may actually curve or even fold in upon itselfin the fourth, fifth, or some higher dimension. If so, we may be able tosideslip through these higher levels and relocate in another place inthree-dimensional space. Characters in science fiction do it all the time,and some theorists have already proposed that the universe may actuallyconsist of up to eleven dimensions.Clearly there is much work left for physicists to do, and in the nexthundred years we can expect many surprises. If not, that will the biggestsurprise of all.                                   [Image]J.
