<P class=keys align=center>Its "nice" that Q Todd rewrote the bylaws (See: <b>2nd Last Para</b>) of 

the Sigma Alfa Epsilon Fraternity, I had no idea MY complete rewrite of the 

Student Government bylaws and its Student Body wide referendum in 1973 had such 

an exemplary impact. In fact I had entirely forgotten about it. At our 25th 

anniversary at Allegheny, as I shook his hand on the steps of Bentley Hall to 

congratulate him on his appointment by President Clinton, I said "See how much 

good it did ya to have <B>me</B> kick your ass twice. eh? eh? eh?" smile 

smile "<B>See...things always work out for the best in life</B>". To see those comments, parroted in the last two paragraphs here was stunning. 

After thirty years of looking in the mirror, perhaps I can be forgiven for wondering if at its root,
the entire affair was just a matter of a gay <B>Dick</b>inson and <b>what won't reach where</B>  ;)</P>

<P class=bible align=center>As regards the commercialization of Life and the ownership of Genes I have to go with the Bible on this one.<br><I>Then the Lord God said Behold, the man has become 

like one of us, knowing good and evil, and now, lest he put forth his hand and 

take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever" - therefore the Lord 

God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was 

taken. He drove out the man; and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the 

cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the 

tree of life.</I> <a id="Bible"> </A><SMALL>The Holy Bible Genesis
