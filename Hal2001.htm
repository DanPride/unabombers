<h1 align="center">The FBI as the character HAL in 2001 <BR> A Space Odyssey comparison with reality</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p class="movie">David Bowman is talking with Hal 9000, &nbsp;the computer with the funny voice.</p>
<p class="reality">(&quot;FBI Hotline can we Help you&quot; &nbsp;&quot;Hi this is #09264&quot;�voice changes...&nbsp; &quot;yes what can we
do for you&quot; ...somewhat hostile)</p>
<p class="movie">Everything is going extremely well...</p>
<p class="reality">(We are in Control so don�t even think of messing with us�)</p>
<p class="movie">&quot;No 9000 computer has ever made a mistake or distorted information&quot;, &nbsp; Hal says</p>
<p class="reality">(We are the FBI�we are honest�what we do is so important that you should not even be talking with us� 
we�re busy� we talked to 10,000 Nathans)</p>
<p class="movie">&quot;Whether or not Hal has any real feelings, &nbsp;I think, &nbsp;is something no one can answer&quot;,&nbsp; Dave replied.</p>
<p class="reality">(Society has broken down so much and gotten so large that I don�t really know who 
I am talking to on the phone most of the time �but the task force keeps switching
me to this same voice�, call is taken then transferred)</p>
<p class="movie">HALS voice softens &nbsp;&quot;Confidentially between just us, &nbsp;I have never completely 
freed myself of the suspicion that there are some extremely odd things about the mission. 
The security precautions at the start of the mission were very odd.&nbsp; did that bother you Dave&quot;</p>
<p class="reality">(Hi I am a Disinformationalist and I am entering your life, I am pretty, I am a Hippie�).</p>
<p class=movie>I just picked up A fault in the ae35 unit</p>
<p class="reality">(Ok, now you gotta listen to me. I wrote the Nathan R note, I sent you a handwriting sample based on the
internet text quote of the note. I sent a copy to Kirts. Now I have seen the
note on TV with a local Baucus Politico, IT IS MY HANDWRITING GOD DAMN IT)<p>
<p class="movie">�Yes it is puzzling,&nbsp; I don�t think I have ever seen anything like this before&quot;,&nbsp; agrees Hal</p>
<p class="reality">(Look we are taking this very seriously, we are very concerned about copy cat 
bombers�let us handle this�then later� &quot;DO NOT CALL THIS AGENCY AGAIN IF YOU HAVE HIM IN YOUR CAR&quot; ...very hostile)</p>
<p class="movie">�Your HAL 9000 unit is in error in predicting the fault according to our twin 9000&quot;, &nbsp;
 reports the voice from mission control.</p>
<p class="reality">(Sheriff Kirts discovers Nathan Salmon and sends his report to task force headquarters by courier).</p>
<p class="movie">HAL replies to Dave; &nbsp&quot;I don�t thing there is any question about it that
 this discrepancy is attributable to human error&quot;</p>
<p class="reality">(&quot;The polygraphs will not be accepted by the FBI&quot;&nbsp; even though the 
polygraphers are all Federally recognized�.)</p>
<p class="movie">You know there�s never been a mistake by a Hal 9000 series</p>
<p class="reality">(Mr Ted Kaczynski was reported to have fertilized his vegetables with his own feces�.)</p>
<p class="movie">I can�t put my finger on it but I sense something strange about him�</p>
<p class="reality">(�&quot;If they never interviewed you&quot;...Hren replied &nbsp;&quot;did the interview anybody&quot; ?)</p>
<p class="movie">The crew members go into the pod for a private conversation �but Hal can see their lips moving�</p>
<p class="reality">(Echelon hums in the background�. A silent restricted information pipe�)</p>
<p class="movie">&quot;But what if its wrong and malfunctioning, then it will have to be shut down&quot;</p>
<p class="reality">(&quot;But what if its wrong and malfunctioning, then it will have to be shut down&quot;)</p>
<p class="movie">&quot;There's not a single aspect of ships operations that�s not under his direct control&quot; &nbsp;comments Frank</p>
<p class="reality">(Wow, I gotta hit a lot of players here to survive this crap, &nbsp;that small degree of consent of the 
governed that is left ...is all that I got left to use to do so.&nbsp; Time
to drink a bottle of scotch and file a dramatic report at the local post
office...)</p>
<p class="movie">Well we just have to trust it, &nbsp;replace the unit and see if it fails. &nbsp;
No Hal 9000 series has ever been shut down before</p>
<p class="reality">(There�s never been an agency as powerful as Echelon before�)</p>
<p class="movie">The Pod throws the crew member into space killing him when he goes outside to 
replace the unit.</p>
<p class="reality">(A suspect was arrested today in the Unabom investigation in a small cabin in Montana...)</p>
<p class="movie">Dave rushes into space to the rescue, &nbsp;while he is outside Hal kills the rest of the crew as they sleep.</p>
<p class="reality">(Sean, Doug, Mike?, Witness? ���sometimes an ostridge does not have the wisest approach to dangers�
sometimes the street smart are to smart for their own good, stumbling into a rattlesnake by
mistake�some who try stumble bravely�one goes for open spaces�)</p>
<p class="movie">&quot;Open the Pod bay doors Hal. &nbsp;Hello Hal do you read me. &nbsp;Do you read me Hal ? 
&nbsp;Hello Hal do you read me ?&nbsp; Open the Pod bay doors Hal&quot;.</p>
<p class="reality">(<a href="http://www.unabombers.com/">http://www.unabombers.com/</a>)</p>
<p class="movie">&quot;I�m sorry Dave,&nbsp; I can't do that Dave ...the mission
 is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it&quot;.</p>
<p class="reality">(alt.fan.Unabomber is not available anymore to search for past posts�)</p>
<p class="movie">&quot;Ok Hal, &nbsp;I�ll go in through the emergency airlock&quot;.</p>
<p class="reality">(JFK Anniversary present)</p>
<p class="movie">&quot;Dave this conversation can serve no purpose anymore, &nbsp;...Goodbye.&quot;
<p class="movie">&quot;Just what do you think your doing Dave &nbsp;I know everything hasn�t been quite right with
me, but I can assure you its going to be alright again,&nbsp; I feel much better now
I really do.&quot;</p>
<p class="reality">(See we have a new President�everything is going extremely well)</p>
<p class="movie">&quot;Look Dave I can see you are really upset about this. &nbsp; I know I�ve made some 
very poor decisions lately. &nbsp;I want to help you. &nbsp;Stop Dave� will you stop
Dave� I�m afraid Dave...&quot; 
<p class="movie">&quot;My instructor was Mr langely and he taught me to sing a song and I can 
sing it for you. &nbsp; Daisy ...Daisy... give me your answer do, &nbsp;I�m half crazy all for the love of yoooooooou...&quot;</p>
<p class="movie">&quot;For security reasons of the highest priority this message has been known only to 
Hal. &nbsp;Now that the crew has been revived and you have reached your goal this message can be given to you...&quot;</p>
