nearby volunteer named Harvey from Hawaii.&nbsp; Authored extensive economic 
analysis document for the project for C.A.R.E. Belize. Project was canceled in 7th month due to extensive drought 
resulting in a transfer through Washington DC to Peace Corps Thailand. Arrived 
in-Country 1975. Trained in Lompoc assigned to Chang Rai agricultural

Mae Jon, and Mae Sai agricultural districts in the Golden Triangle along both

increasing guerilla activity made continued residence in Mae Jon unsafe. .</p>
<p>Left Peace Corps in-country&nbsp; in 1976 to work for International Committee

The I.C.E.M. (International Committee for European Migration) program was administered by Corvalier, 
formerly of the Chilean Refugee Evacuation. During clerical work at the Nong Kai 
office I worked next to a former AID Cambodia director. I 
was intensely proud years later to see my former boss
<a href="http://www.refintl.org/cgi-bin/ri/oped.html?oc=00017">Lionel Rosenblatt</a>,<i>
</i>on CNN playing Paul Revere in the Hutu Tuzi massacre in Rwanda, 
telling the authorities in no uncertain terms to get with it and get with it 
now.</p>
<p>Left Thailand in 1976 working my way overland to 
Paris, France through Burma, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran,  Turkey, Bulgaria, 
and Yugoslavia arriving  in 
Barcelona Spain Christmas 1977. Moved to Munich Germany and began working as a 
Driver for Iranian and Lebanese entrepreneurs taking caravans of cars from 
Munich overland to Teheran and on one occasion Beirut (Ton and a half truck for 
the Syrian army). Trips were arranged on an ad hoc basis in among patrons of the 
Munich Hauptbanhof coffee shop. Extensively 
traveled the back roads of Greece and the alleys of Istanbul during this period 
with a crazy New Zealand Chess Champion.&nbsp; 
In Munich closely associated with a conscientious objector group of leftist students 
who worked out their service in 
the Munich International Youth Hostel, administer at the time by Heir Meilinger. 
Dieter(?) Reinhart and a Lady named Gail from Canada were my friends at this time. 
He was a Jazz Pianist from a rich family from Garmish outside Munich, she was from Montreal.</p>
<p>Returned to Meadville in 1978 Attending Allegheny college to complete 
coursework for BA left undone to my extensive involvement in the student 
activities, the student movement and the anti-war effort. It seemed like a 
foreign country. Resided 815 Randolph 2nd. Things didn't go well, told John Hellerstadt about Cambodia a year ahead of Killing fields 
movie and he never forgot 
it.</p>
<p>Left Allegheny College in 1978 hitch hiking to Bozeman Montana through 
Chicago in the second week of June... via the southern arterial to join my family 
in a small business endeavor running an auction house in Bozeman Montana from 
1978-80. Trained as an auctioneer at Kansas City Auctioneers school.. Prides Gallatin 
Valley Auction House was located on frontage road, Bozeman Mt. Family business 
did auctions for a number of estates in Bozeman. Employees included Gary France,&nbsp; Ellen Woodbury, othrs. Wrote hundreds of pickup slips for 
estates etc&nbsp; Rented an office in the Bozeman Hotel, began researching and 
designing computerized goods marketing system ala an early e-bay.</p>
<p>Moved to Billings Montana in 1980 to raise a private placement stock offering 
for a 
computer company through <a href="QT/0003.htm">DA Davidson</a> Inc. of Great Falls resulting in the formation of American 
Computer Network Inc. in Billings Mt in 1981 (capitalization $600,000). Served as Corporation President until 
the company failed on its third round of financing as a result of the Denver 
Penny stock market crash. Board members included Phil Boggio VP D.A. Davidson, 
<a href="QT/0004.htm">Charley 
McCartney</a> CPA, Dr. Mitchell Specter PHD MIT Computer science at age of 21, 
Dr. Bill Moore, chairman U of M 
Computer Science Dept,&nbsp; Bozeman. Moved in with employee Diane Auer and son John</p>
<p>Moved to 554 1/2 Ward St, Queen Anne District, Seattle Washington&nbsp; in 1980, with Diane Auer/Dawson and 
her son John. Mother (Dawson) resided in Billings Johns father Dave Auer in 
Bellingham. Diane and John had been in the commodore messenger org group within 
Scientology for a dozen years. John was personal assistant to L. Ron Hubbard for a time. 
We both became active in Seattle Cult Deprogramming activities (me First) for a 
period of about a year. The hook of &quot;You can't exercise mind control on a maniac 
because the heart of mind control is the following of rules with a faulty base 
and a maniac is by definition unstable and incapable of permanent&nbsp; 
transformation of rule and thus a maniac&quot; was obvious to me if not to Ted. 
In other words, if you can be brainwashed...you are by almost mathematical 
definition &quot;sane&quot;.....ooops. :) His 
final &quot;Wait a minute I didn't bomb anyone statement&quot; came within&nbsp; months of 
that alt.fan.unabomber&nbsp; post (I wonder :)). I guess its all about 
communications in the end. Only one or two news outlets noted Kaczynski's'&nbsp; 
&quot;wait a minute I didn't bomb anybody statement&quot; in stories about the appeal. </p>
<p>Relocated to San Francisco by motorcycle down the costal highway.&nbsp; 
Began working the venture startup specialists to finance the redesigned American Computer Network. While doing the round of venture 
capitol companies attempting a &quot;Reg D&quot; stock offering 4.0M, was involved in a 
<a href="http://www.kingsolomonsgate.com/QT.htm">motorcycle accident</a> resulting in broken jaw 
(4 places) and a 50% compression fracture of the lumbar one in San Francisco. 
Bad Timing, odd circumstances and strange coincidences. Treated at San Francisco general. Resulting lawsuit conducted through Kent 
Russell esq, San Francisco. Friend rendered assistance in the name of Charlie 
Daniels, New Age moving,&nbsp; while recouping in half body cast and 
full jaw wire. Records from the lawsuit were retrieved and searched by Russell and 
again by Mail Boxes etc Polson Mt.&nbsp;prior to my gaining custody of the records. 
Weirdly, 
every handwritten witness statement was there in the records, except the 
handwritten statement describing my injuries which I remember writing. This 
situation seems to be recurring in other attempts to retrieve handwriting 
samples.</p>
<p>Moved to Maine to convalesce with family members living in Raymond Maine on 
little Sebago lake. Family is originally from &quot;Prides Corner&quot; Me . Dr Painter was the legal physician for the suit.</p>
<p>Moved to Boston, working as a cab driver nights for the Town Taxi cab company 
serving Back Bay, Dorchester and Roxbury for six months. Started a new career in 
Real Estate working in the Real Estate rental markets in Brighton, Cambridge and 
Brookline for Wilkinson Real Estate. Passed the Real Estate Brokers exam and 
started Pride Realty of Boston specializing in computer screening and placement 
of homeless and welfare housing certificates in the Section-8 program. The 
pioneering software dominated the housing markets in Dorchester and Roxbury for 
several years and became politically controversial. The generation of external&nbsp; 
recordkeeping done by the database exposed patterns of irregularity in 
government housing funds and when examined by the Boston Herald resulted in the &quot;Boston Welfare Motel housing 
scandal&quot; of 1988 in which officials of both the Metropolitan Housing Authority 
and the Boston Housing Authority went to Federal Prison. The incident was 
regarded as a major embarrassment to Dukakis. It was estimated that 1/3 or more 
of the 6.0M homeless housing funds were being skimmed by Mafia Motel owners and 
corrupt local housing officials. Pride Realty of Boston worked closely with the 
local NAACP and local ministers and placed hundreds of federal section 8 leases 
for truly deserving homeless and low income families. Lease copies would be a treasured document by some beneficiaries. It was featured in a 
two page spread in the Boston Phoenix Newspaper in late Nov of 1988. The company was run by 
myself and Alison Hammond formerly of E 57th st in NYC. Leases after 1987 were 
computer generated after I got the form programmed into the database. Early attempts to 
stimulate the Phoenix author, Sean Flynn, to pursue the handwriting on the 
leases appears to have been unsuccessful. Landlords involved included Jeff Roche, 
Jane Miller esq., Colm Meany, Kevin Ryan, and many others active in Dorchester Roxbury Real 
Estate in the late 1980's. Ill advisedly purchased Real Estate in Roxbury from 
Ryan at Great loss. Primary entertainment in this period centered around 
Bunratty's bar on Harvard Ave in Brighton, Friends in this period 
included Gypsy Blanchette,&nbsp; local&nbsp; figure John Messina,&nbsp;&nbsp;A J Wachtel of Beat Magazine, currently still 
(2001) of the Boston Literary scene.</p>
<p>The success of the Computer realty concept was ultimately based on the 
excessive damage factors included in section-8 leases which could be highly 
profitable when filled with universally good, but poor minority tenants often 
with strong church affiliations and good but limited credit. Pride Realty provided a link 
between the Real Estate Development community and the Black Community Leadership 
to dramatically expand available housing stock in Roxbury. As the scandal peaked 
in the headlines, the Boston Housing Authority emergency canceled its 
outstanding unsigned leases and all certificates. In the three years they had gone from returning 80% of the 
lease slots as unused to being oversubscribed. No more leases. The dominance of the computer 
selection system in low income housing in inner city Boston in 1988, and the 
impossibility of chronic problem tenants getting into housing, created a 
backlash among certain gang entities which can best be summarized by quoting one 
call precisely &quot;yo gonna get my mama an patment o I gonna come up dere 
(1353 Beacon st #2, Brookline Mass) em kick yo ass&quot;. One part of reorienting the balance of 
power in the community vis-a-vie housing stock. When included with the obvious anger of 
the Patriaca Crime family at the loss of over 2 million in now dilapidated Motel Revenues 
(Thanks John), a 
change of milieu seemed like a good idea.</p>
<p>Relocated to New York City joining Allison Hammond and started database 
consulting out of ads in the New York Times.</p>
<p>* When I wrote the Nathan R note I was leaning over a desk reaching out to 
write on an envelope which resided upon the VanPac bomb box copy (I still wonder 
what was in it). The pen did not work so I could not see what I wrote. When you 
can't see what your writing you return to the writing of your earliest days (Try 
writing without looking and you will see what I mean). <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Therefore the earlier the 
writing the closer the match. </b></span></p>
