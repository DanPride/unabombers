As the Bismarck and the Hood began to exchange shells, His mate said to Ted Brigs "Remember the Exeter...only one survived".&nbsp;
Ted Brigs responded that if there were to be a single survivor it would be him. Moments later he was one of only three 
of 1415 sailors
who survived the Hoods explosion. When he laid the plaque to commemorate the sailors in 2004 he was indeed the single 
survivor.

The first shots of the Civil war were fired from Wilmer McClain's front yard. Disgusted at the human carnage of the
battle of Bull Run that filled his yard in the hours that followed, Wilmer McClain removed himself and his
family to Appomattox, sure the war would never find him or his family there. There, 
Robert E Lee surrendered to Ulysses S Grant in his living room four years later. 
The American Civil War, literally and actually, began in his front yard&nbsp; and ended in his Living Room</p>

Kennedy's secretary was named Lincoln and Lincolns secretary was named Kennedy. 
Booth shot from a theater and fled to a warehouse,&nbsp; Oswald shot from a

Kennedy go on and on and on until you can not seriously suggest coincidence and 
really believe that it is possibly just, and only, that.</p>

<p class="Story" align="center">
its probably the only proof you need.</p>
