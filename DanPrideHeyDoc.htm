<p class="story" align="center">The ad ran on the 
Back Cover of &quot;Hospitals and Health Networks&quot; hangs over the Juke box in the &quot;Bank Bar&quot;, Saratoga Ca, ...Dettling's Regular Bar. The Sunset photo was taken by Bar owner Jim Sullivan. He hung it in the most prominent spot in the bar the <u>same day</u> the Nathan R note was delivered to the New York Times in New 
York. The Magazines publication date of June 20, 1993 is also <b>coincidentally</b> the 
<u>same day</u> the Nathan R letter was mailed. The&nbsp; note was mailed in a postal box late at night and postmarked the next morning
<a href="News/93-10-07-HC-NathanR-Reward-Announced-2.htm#NathanMailDate">[Houston Chronicle]</a> on June 21, 1993.

The ad's headline says<br>
<b>&quot;The Sun has just set on Everyone Else's Physician Referral Program&quot;</b><br>
...a rather interesting headline if you think about 
it and the circumstances :)</p>

The Ad was designed by Jim Hurdle of New York. Formerly my boss at RCA records. An 
advertisers copy of the Magazine was delivered about a week early which I gave 
to Jim as a &quot;Thanks&quot; for the free use of the Sunset photo. He had it framed and hung it over the Juke box days later.
