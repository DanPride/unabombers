<strong>Unabomber</strong> Is So Hard to Catch 

 Random attacks, careful coverups perplex authorities 



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> Michael Taylor, Chronicle Staff Writer 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">From Oklahoma, the militant, crew-cut visage of a suspect in chains was beamed 
out to the world only two days after the federal building was bombed to 
oblivion. But 17 years after the UNABOM killer began his deadly bombing spree, 
he is still at large, confounding the same federal agencies that so quickly 
pounced on an alleged Oklahoma bomber.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Why does the UNABOM terrorist, who struck again Monday in Sacramento, continue 
to elude authorities?
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''We'd love to solve this one just like the one in Oklahoma City is being 
solved,'' FBI spokesman Rick Smith said. ''But this (UNABOM case) is a much 
different situation -- there are . . . just indiscriminate, periodic instances 
where he plants or sends a bomb.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Yesterday, the FBI announced that the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> recently mailed out three letters describing his motives -- a tantalizing 
break in the case that has made investigators much more optimistic.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Nevertheless, experienced private investigators say that if the case is solved, 
it will be through a combination of detailed forensic work, lucky breaks and 
infiltration into whatever group the UNABOM killer may be part of -- if the 
attacker belongs to a group at all.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In a letter to the New York Times in June 1993, the UNABOM suspect wrote, ''We 
are an anarchist group calling ourselves FC.'' But authorities have never been 
able to flesh out that hint, and they assume he still operates by himself.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Experts emphasize that a random killer who works alone and is tidy and careful 
about covering up his tracks is extremely difficult to catch.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''With Oklahoma and with the World 
Trade Center bombing, the agents were able to track them down by vehicle 
identification numbers,'' said Emeryville private investigator Nancy Pemberton, 
referring to bomb-damaged auto parts that led the FBI to the suspects. ''With 
the UNABOM case, they're between a rock and a hard place. Apparently, that 
person is much more sophisticated and is not leaving the kind of traces left in 
the other two cases.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The UNABOM case has confounded federal agents since it began on May 25, 1978, 
when a package found in a university parking lot in Chicago exploded, injuring 
a security guard. Since then, there have been 15 incidents attributed to the 
UNABOM killer, including the latest, a package bomb that killed a timber 
industry lobbyist.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The UNABOM suspect has claimed two other victims along the way -- a 
computer store owner in Sacramento in December 1985 and an advertising 
executive in New Jersey almost exactly 10 years later. Still, no suspect has 
been identified.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the Oklahoma City case, Timothy McVeigh was identified as a prime suspect 
after investigators traced pieces of the Ryder truck he apparently had rented 
and parked in front of the federal building shortly before the 9:04 a.m. blast 
last Wednesday. Less than two hours later, driving a ratty car with no license 
plate and carrying a concealed weapon, he was stopped by a suspicious Oklahoma 
state trooper.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Apart from a brief glimpse by a witness eight years ago, the UNABOM killer has 
never been identified, let alone apprehended.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''The UNABOM guy is playing a game with the authorities,'' said Michael 
Hershman, president of the Fairfax Group, a Virginia- based private 
investigation firm. ''He doesn't want to get caught, and he's challenging the 
authorities. The guy in Oklahoma didn't look at this as a challenge. You don't 
go speeding away from the scene in a car with no plates. That's like 'Come and 
catch me.' ''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">McVeigh, it now appears, probably was not operating alone. The UNABOM suspect 
apparently is.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''If you've got two people involved in criminal activity, you have 10 times the 
chance of finding the guy than if you have one person,'' said Graham 
Desvernine, a San Francisco private investigator who spent 26 years as an FBI 
agent.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''The Oklahoma City bombing does not lend itself to having been done by a sole 
perpetrator,'' Desvernine said. ''It always takes a group to pull off something 
like this, and 
you're almost always going to solve a case like this.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Indeed, in the swift-moving Oklahoma case, agents have already been able to 
link chemical elements on McVeigh's clothes and in his car to residue found at 
the blast site.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the UNABOM case, investigators have managed over the years to put together a 
fairly extensive forensic profile -- they know the killer likes to handcraft 
his bombs out of fine hardwoods, fastened by homemade screws and assembled with 
finesse.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''This may well be a forensic case,'' said Chuck Morton, criminalistics 
laboratory director at Hayward's Institute of Forensic Sciences and a veteran 
of the Robert F. Kennedy assassination case and the Ted Bundy and Juan Corona 
mass murder investigations.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''But forensic science is not very helpful unless you have something to connect 
it to. It has to point to somebody 
first, make a connection to somebody suspicious.''
