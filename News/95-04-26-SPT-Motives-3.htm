</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>DATELINE:</strong> SACRAMENTO, Calif.  



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Is he a tree-hugger or laid-off airline employee? Does he detest computers? 
Bear a bitter grudge against a college professor?
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Is his motive revenge, or is he simply a twisted publicity hound?
</p><p class="body" align="Left">For 17 years, a wily figure known as the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> has been on the loose in 
America, spreading terror and death through carefully polished bombs concealed 
inside parcels sent through the U.S. mail.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">His devices have injured 23 people and killed three others, including a 
lobbyist for timber companies who died in the latest attack at the California 
Forestry Association headquarters here Monday afternoon.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A psychological profile suggests the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> has little more than a high 
school education. Yet he has stumped this nation's sharpest crime-fighters, 
leading them on a confounding chase without precedent in the annals of 
criminology.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> has finally broken his silence.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Tuesday, the FBI announced that authorities have obtained three letters 
from the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> postmarked April 20 from Oakland. At least two of the 
three arrived on the day of the bombing.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Jim Freeman, FBI special agent in charge of the San Francisco office, said 
that in the letters the bomber describes his own actions and motives for the 
first time since he surfaced in 1978.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;We are hopeful there will be something in the content of the letters that 
will cause the public to recognize this individual,&quot;Freeman said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI, he said, is considering releasing details from the letters as 
early as today.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In one of the 
letters, to the New York Times, the writer says he has 
spent considerable time perfecting ever-deadlier devices, but that he would 
stop killing people if a newspaper or magazine with nationwide circulation 
published a lengthy article written by him.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The letter offered the most detailed explanation yet of what the bomber 
says are his motives. It also taunted the FBI.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Clearly we are in a position to do a great deal of damage,&quot;the 
single-spaced, typed letter to the Times, said. 
&quot;And it doesn't appear that 
the FBI is going to catch us any time soon. The FBI is a joke.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A second letter went to David Gelernter, a Yale University computer science 
professor who was badly hurt by a mail bomb he opened in June 1993. Gelernter 
on Tuesday declined to discuss the contents of his letter.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Only once before has the bomber 
communicated, in a brief letter to the New 
York Times nearly two years ago. In that note, as in the one delivered on 
Monday, he described himself as an 
&quot;anarchist&quot;and said he was from a group 
called 
&quot;FC.&quot;In both letters to the Times, the letter-writer used the 
first-person plural, though investigators who have spent years trying to break 
the case believe that the bomber is a single white man in his 40s.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Monday's explosion took the life of Gilbert Murray, 47, who was killed when 
he opened a shoebox-sized parcel that arrived through the mail. The powerful 
explosion badly damaged the association's office; bomb fragments were found 
140 feet from the reception counter where Murray had been standing.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Authorities said the bomb, mailed in a rectangular wooden box with an 
Oakland postmark, was not addressed to 
Murray. Instead, it was mailed to 
Murray's predecessor, William Dennison, who resigned a year ago after serving 
as association president for 14 years.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> has been blamed for 16 attacks over 17 years. Many of his 
attacks have had a Northern California connection.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Two years ago, the federal government formed a task force, assigning as 
many as 40 agents to work full-time to crack the Unabom case - so named 
because the attacker shows a preference for universities and airlines.- Information from the Los Angeles Times and New York Times is in this report.
