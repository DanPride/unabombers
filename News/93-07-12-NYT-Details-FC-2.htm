</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">They arrive in the mail looking innocuous enough, neatly wrapped in brown 
parcels or in elaborately polished wooden boxes, in a book, a manuscript or a 
package that feels like it contains a video cassette.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Or they are left lying on laboratory desks, concealed as a notebook or a piece 
of scientific equipment. Twice, they have been disguised as road hazards -- 
wooden boards left in parking lots with nails sticking out of them.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Whatever their appearance, the devices all have two things in common. When 
they are touched or opened, they explode. And, the authorities say, they were 
all crafted by the same person.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Over 15 years, the devices have killed one person and injured 22 others. The 
early targets included an airline executive and a plane manufacturer. More 
recently, the parcels have been sent to scholars who have made significant 
advances in psychology, computer sciences and genetics.

A Six-Year Hiatus
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Even though the bomber has left a trail of clues, when he struck twice last 
month after an inexplicable six-year hiatus investigators seemed no closer to 
catching him than they were when he began his campaign of terror in 1978. In a 
sign of frustration, top investigators at the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
described him in a written report two years ago as 
&quot;one of the most creative and elusive bombers ever encountered.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Now an investigation that had gone stale has been revived. For the first time, 
the bomber has spoken publicly, sending a letter to The New York Times last 
month that said it came from 
&quot;FC&quot; and promising more information. The letter, like the recent mail bombs, bore 
postal markings indicating it was from Sacramento, Calif. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">And, confronted with the letter and information from interviews with many 
earlier victims, investigators have reluctantly disclosed that the bomber 
leaves an unusual signature: the initials 
&quot;FC&quot; are engraved in the package bombs in a way that is meant to survive the blasts.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Since his last attacks -- on Prof. Charles Epstein on June 22 at his home in 
Tiburon, Calif., and Prof. David Gelernter, who opened a package bomb two days 
later at his Yale 
University office -- the bomber has been idle. But university campuses remain 
fearful, and law enforcement officials who have spent years investigating the 
case expect him to strike again.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Officials at Yale said last week that doctors do not yet know whether the 
injuries to Professor Gelernter, a leading computer-science theorist, will be 
permanent. His right arm and eye were badly injured and both of his hands were 
damaged, but officials said his condition had continued to improve. He is said 
by friends to be anxious to return to his computer, confident that he can crack 
the case.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Professor Epstein, a top geneticist and pediatrician, was described on Friday 
by a spokesman at the University of California at San Francisco as improving 
but likely to require a long recovery.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He lost three fingers on his right hand and suffered a broken arm and abdominal 
injuries.

Tantalizing Leads, Then a Cold Trail
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Federal officials say that until the latest packages were opened, the trail 
had grown cold. Investigators, some of whom had spent more than a decade on the 
case, said they had exhausted all leads, were unable to come up with a clear 
motive, did not know why the victims had been selected and were stymied by 
evidence that consisted of little more than the remains of the bomber's 
handiwork and a momentary sighting of a suspect.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">For hundreds of hours the investigators searched through criminal files and 
other computer data bases, hoping to match their theoretical profiles of a 
killer with an actual person who, they surmise, moved from the Chicago area, 
where the early bombings occurred, to Utah and California, where later packages 
appeared. They held conferences an average of once a year with local law 
enforcement authorities. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">They questioned scores of possible 
suspects, from failed university students to disgruntled airline employees to 
people who had been reported by neighbors and co-workers after the case was 
featured on several television crime shows. They took the bomber's sparse 
writings and sent them to experts in codes and forensic psychiatry. In their 
desperation, they even turned to a clairvoyant.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;It had been frustrating,&quot; said John C. Killorin, a spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms, one of the three Federal agencies working on the case.  
&quot;You keep chewing on the same thing, hoping to go further, but it's just not 
there. Ultimately, you reach the point where there is no more work to be done.&quot; He added, 
&quot;You just hope that the person has died, or been put in jail or a hospital, or 
moved away.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Christopher Ronay, the F.B.I.'s top explosives expert, who has chased the 
bomber for 
more than a decade, says that in his 22 years at the F.B.I. he has never faced 
a more challenging or puzzling case.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;He is creative,&quot; Mr. Ronay said, 
&quot;because almost every one of the bombs has been crafted in a unique way, so much 
so that to the untrained eye, they may not be related. And he's elusive because 
he's picked his targets in a way in which we can't find a common element.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Originally known as the 
&quot;Junk Yard Bomb&quot; case because the devices have been made of common materials like scrap wood 
and lamp cord, the case name was changed in the 1980's to 
&quot;<strong>Unabom&quot;</strong> as it became apparent that the bomber wanted to torment universities and 
airlines.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bombs have become progressively more powerful. The parcels used in the 
early bombings contained smokeless powder, but since 1985 they have contained a 
more powerful ammonium 
nitrate mixture. He often constructs the bombs with more than one detonating 
device to be sure they go off.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He had struck 12 times before last month, injuring 20 people and killing Hugh 
Campbell Scrutton outside his Sacramento computer store in 1985. Mr. Scrutton 
stumbled upon a brown bag concealing a bomb. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bomber has never explained his motives, but in a few instances has sent 
messages to his targets a few weeks before he struck. He sent a letter to an 
airline executive, exhorting him to read a book that would be arriving in the 
mail. He asked a professor to read a forthcoming manuscript.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">About the time the parcels were sent to Professor Epstein and Professor 
Gelernter, an intriguing new clue surfaced. The bomber sent a letter to The New 
York Times identifying the author as 
&quot;an anarchist group calling ourselves FC.&quot; The letter promised to 
&quot;give information about our goals at some future time,&quot; a suggestion taken by investigators that the bomber intends to strike again.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Despite the reference to a group, the authorities still believe the bombs are 
the work of a lone white man. They base their theory on analysis of the bombs, 
a few letters sent to their victims in advance of parcels, and a brief glimpse 
of a suspect who was kneeling beside one of the deadly objects moments before 
it exploded in a Salt Lake City parking lot in 1987. 


Selecting Victims: What Kind of Link?
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Based on the letter to The Times and the new round of bombings, investigators 
now wonder whether the bomber has periodically picked his victims from the 
columns of The Times or the 600 newspapers that use its news service. 
At least three of his targets, including the two last month, had been featured 
in Times articles in ways that characterize them as leading figures in their 
fields. Professors Epstein and Gelernter had both spoken of major breakthroughs 
in their fields, as had an earlier target, Prof. James McConnell of the 
University of Michigan.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Professor McConnell, a psychologist, had made significant advances on the 
learning and memory transfer in invertebrates. He died in 1990 of causes 
unrelated to the bomb.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">On each of the parcel bombs he sent last month, the bomber used the return 
address of professors from California State University in Sacramento. Neither 
knew the victims or is suspected of sending the packages. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The letter to The Times came in an envelope with a Sacramento postmark. The 
writer also provided a nine-digit code resembling a Social Security number so 
that future 
communications could be verified as coming from the same person. The first 
three digits of the number were the same for Social Security cards issued to 
California residents. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Because of the California connections, Federal authorities in recent days have 
set up their headquarters for the case in San Francisco. The enlarged team 
consists of dozens of full-time investigators from the F.B.I., the Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the United States Postal Inspectors. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The targets have all been involved in computer technology, biotechnology or the 
airline industry but have little else in common.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I don't think this bomber knows his victims personally,&quot; said Patrick Fischer, the head of the Computer Science Department at 
Vanderbilt University, who was the target of a bomb on May 5, 1982. Professor 
Fischer had established a reputation in the 1960's and 1970's as a specialist 
in the 
theory of computation, which is generally concerned with how long it takes 
machines to solve problems. He was not injured, but his secretary was maimed 
when she opened the package.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I think the victims are symbols,&quot; Professor Fischer said, 
&quot;not individuals this person personally knows and dislikes.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Percy A. Wood, the former president of United Airlines, agreed. Mr. Wood 
survived a bomb that was concealed in the novel 
&quot;Ice Brothers&quot; by Sloan Wilson that arrived at his home in Lake Forest, Ill., on June 10, 
1980.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;It's distressing,&quot; said Mr. Wood, who recently regained use of a few fingers. 
&quot;I've talked over the years to the Post Office and F.B.I., but we don't get 
anywhere.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">There is speculation that the bomber may have anti-Semitic tendencies; the 
latest victims were Jewish and some return addresses and signatures used 
on letters sent to targets have had Jewish-sounding names.

Incomplete Portrait From Sparse Details
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The authorities say the bomber is probably in his late 30's or early 40's and 
about 6 feet tall, with reddish-blond hair and a ruddy complexion. The man seen 
kneeling beside the bomb in Salt Lake City in 1987 was described as having a 
thin mustache, weighing about 165 pounds and wearing smoke-tinted glasses and a 
hooded sweatshirt.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">F.B.I. personality profiles describe him as a meticulous dresser, probably so 
obsessive as to be a chronic maker of lists. They say he is the kind of person 
who would drive an older car that he keeps well maintained.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Investigators say he has left another signature besides the initials 
&quot;FC&quot; -- the intricate way that he constructs the bombs, making many parts by hand 
even though they can be bought at a hardware store and elaborately polishing 
wooden components.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">They believe he derives satisfaction from hours polishing and buffing bomb 
material, even though the material is ultimately blown away. By constructing 
even the most elementary components, the bomber has made it harder to trace 
where he acquired the parts.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Convinced that the bomber spent his formative years in the Chicago area, the 
location of the first four bombings, the authorities have studied the names of 
more than 80,000 people who moved from Chicago. They also believe that he has 
lived in Utah, where two bombs have appeared, and that he may now be in 
California.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;We are looking for someone who has moved around like that, who has been out of 
touch or in prison during the lull periods,&quot; said Mr. Ronay of the F.B.I. He did not offer a theory to explain the time 
between attacks.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Another investigator did. 
&quot;Maybe he was just happy,&quot; he said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
