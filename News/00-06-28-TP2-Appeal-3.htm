<strong>UNABOMBER</strong> PONDERS ORDER THAT COULD COST HIM HIS LIFE;
KACZYNSKI MAY GET PLEA DEAL OVERTURN 



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> By Howard Mintz Knight Ridder Newspapers 



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>DATELINE:</strong> SAN JOSE, CALIF.  



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">From his maximum-security prison cell in Colorado, Theodore Kaczynski, known as 
the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> is back to the exhaustive writing regimen he perfected through two decades 
holed up in a cabin in the Montana wilderness.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But while Kaczynski once spent his days and nights railing against the 
technological revolution, he now devotes his time musing about the law. And if 
his latest treatise is persuasive enough, it could cost him his life.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">As a result of an unusual order last fall from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals in San Francisco, Kaczynski has an opportunity to upend a plea deal he 
cut with the U.S. Justice Department two years ago that enabled him to avoid 
the death penalty for his murderous 17-year bombing campaign.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The court order allows Kaczynski to seek a new trial based on his argument that 
he was coerced into pleading guilty, in part because he was improperly 
prevented from directing his own defense. A successful appeal would re-open one 
of the most sensational murder cases in U.S. history, subjecting Kaczynski to 
possible execution. It also might allow this notorious defendant to settle a 
vexing dilemma surrounding death-penalty cases nationwide: Whether a defendant 
or his lawyer has the ultimate authority to call the shots in a 
courtroom.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I wish it wasn't the Kaczynski case,&quot; said Hastings College of the Law Professor Rory Little, former chief of 
appeals in the San Francisco U.S. attorney's office. 
&quot;If it wasn't the Kaczynski case, where the pressure to affirm the conviction is 
huge, this raises major questions about the relationship for defendants and 
criminal defense lawyers.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">For his part, Kaczynski seems unfazed by the potential consequences of his 
case, having made clear that he prefers death to spending the rest of his life 
in a 12-by-7-foot prison cell that is just a shade smaller than the ramshackle 
cabin he owned near Lincoln, Mont.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Writing in the third person, Kaczynski said in one of his court briefs: 
&quot;From shortly after his arrest ... Kaczynski had repeatedly made it clear to his 
attorneys that if presented with a choice between life imprisonment and 
a death sentence, he would just as soon have the death sentence, or would even 
prefer it to life imprisonment.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Both Kaczynski and the Justice Department have filed their final legal 
arguments in the case, and the federal appeals court is likely to decide the 
appeal sometime this year.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">--- New trial, new issues ---
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The government is trying to preserve the plea deal, arguing in court papers 
filed in March that Kaczynski voluntarily pleaded guilty in January 1998 to a 
bombing spree that killed three people and injured 23 others from California to 
New Jersey. Federal prosecutors said in court papers that Kaczynski was well 
aware of the 
&quot;consequences of his plea.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I'm certain the department (of Justice) believes there were no constitutional 
deficiencies and what is going on here is another exercise in gamesmanship,&quot; former Sacramento U.S. Attorney Charles Stevens, once involved in the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> 
prosecution, said last week. 
&quot;This is a case where the I's were dotted and the T's were crossed.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But Stevens and other lawyers knowledgeable about the appeal concede Kaczynski 
has employed his mathematician's keen mind in a way that has forced the federal 
courts to deal with important and unsettled legal issues. Up to now, the courts 
haven't really settled the question of who directs a capital defense: the 
defendant whose life is on the line, or the lawyer, usually appointed by the 
court because most murder defendants can't afford to pay for an attorney.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In stacks of legal papers written in penmanship neat enough to warm a 
grade-school teacher's heart, Kaczynski insists that his defense attorneys, 
Quin Denvir and Judy Clarke, put him in an impossible position because of their 
plan to make his mental state a key element of defense strategy. 
Kaczynski refused to allow them to depict him, as he put it, as a 
&quot;grotesque lunatic.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">--- Denial of rights claimed ---
</p><p class="body" align="Left">As a result, the appeal argues that Kaczynski was coerced into a plea agreement 
because his only option was to go through a trial putting on a defense he 
opposed. Kaczynski also maintains that U.S. District Judge Garland Burrell 
improperly denied him his constitutional right to represent himself once the 
rift with his defense team surfaced.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Burrell struggled with the issue for days as it became clear the relationship 
between Kaczynski and his attorneys had broken down toward the end of 
months-long jury selection. In the end, the judge concluded that Kaczynski's 
bid to represent himself was a ploy to delay the trial.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Denvir, the federal public defender in Sacramento, declined to discuss the 
appeal, other than to say he believes the plea agreement is on firm ground. But 
many defense lawyers, while conceding Kaczynski has raised tough questions, say 
it would set a dangerous precedent to let defendants in capital trials dictate 
defense strategy or represent themselves when there are doubts about their 
mental state.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I don't think it's our obligation to let people commit legal suicide,&quot; said William Moffitt, president of the National Association of Criminal 
Defense Lawyers. 
&quot;Lawyers ought not to be instruments in that way. And this is all overlaid by 
the fact there are real mental health issues here.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Vermont law Professor Michael Mello, who helped Kaczynski with his legal 
arguments until they had a falling out last year, disagrees, saying the federal 
appeals court should order a new trial. Mello has written a book about the case 
and how he believes Kaczynski's Sixth Amendment rights were violated 
by the plea agreement.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I understand and sympathize with what (Denvir and Clarke) did,&quot; Mello said. 
&quot;What they did is what most capital defense attorneys would do. It's the 
conventional wisdom. I just don't agree with it. When you're life is hanging in 
the balance, and if you are mentally competent to stand trial -- and clearly as 
mentally competent as Kaczynski was -- then you call the shots.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;It's your life, it's your crime, it's your trial,&quot; he said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">--- Fuzzy trial strategies ---
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Justice Department, in something of a flip-flop from its trial position, 
now argues in the federal appeals court that Denvir and Clarke -- both widely 
respected, veteran defense lawyers -- had the authority to decide the defense 
strategy, not Kaczynski. Defendants have a recognized right to make decisions 
such as whether to plead guilty or testify at a trial, but the law is less 
clear about issues such as trial strategy.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 9th 
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, suggesting that it may want to clear up that 
question, asked in its order whether a defendant like Kaczynski has a 
constitutional right to prevent defense lawyers from putting on evidence of 
mental impairment during a trial.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Kaczynski, who said in his court papers that such a defense would be 
&quot;unendurable,&quot; argues that he 
&quot;does not suffer from serious mental illness.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Legal experts following the case, as well as former members of the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> prosecution team, suspect Kaczynski is seeking a new trial so he can use it as 
a platform for his political views and to air his anti- technology doctrines. 
As a result, it has come as no surprise that he is trying to keep his case 
alive in the legal system, more than 20 years after he delivered his first bomb 
through the mail.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;It goes with the 
territory,&quot; said Stephen Freccero, one of the four lead prosecutors in the case who now 
works for a San Francisco law firm. 
&quot;You assume there are going to be legal challenges. We were very firm in the 
plea negotiations in trying to minimize that for the sake of the victims. There 
was a big concern to bring finality to the situation.&quot;
