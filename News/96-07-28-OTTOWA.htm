</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Across the United States this morning the Stars and Stripes is at half-staff 
once more. It has barely risen since Easter. The first anniversary of the 
Oklahoma bombing, the attack on the barracks in Dhahran, the loss of TWA Flight 
800, and now the dead and injured in Atlanta. The nation has spent too long in 
remembrance. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Olympic Games was to have been a chance to wave the flag in its proper 
place: at the head of the pole, on top of the world. The American people 
heralded each golden victory last week with a sense of triumphalism that at 
times seemed to border on the hysterical.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Perhaps it was relief that all was well with the world, that Team USA was a 
winner once more. The nightmare of international terrorism could be forgotten 
for the glories of the Dream Team. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">No longer a fortress 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The authorities had nicknamed Atlanta 
&quot;Fort Sport,&quot; but the events of the past 12 days have shown that America is no longer a 
fortress. The growing belief that the loss of TWA Flight 800 was caused by a 
bomb planted at Kennedy Airport and the explosion in Centennial Park Saturday 
show that this is a country of 250 million potential targets. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">It was appropriate that among those who witnessed the Atlanta bombing was 
American swimmer Janet Evans. The former gold medallist had barely been off the 
TV screens all week since her failure in these Games. She is a slick performer, 
graciously wounding her opponents with allegations of cheating, eyes wide with 
her 
own integrity. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Moments before the bomb exploded she was giving yet another interview, this 
time for German TV in the Swatch pavilion near the scene of the blast. As the 
sharp crack of detonation, then the crash of broken glass reached the room , 
she was transformed. No longer the confident Miss America, but a terrified 
young girl, clutching at the arms of her interviewer before wordlessly fleeing 
for safety. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">But where is safe in the U.S. now? So long free from the perils of other lands, 
its citizens woke up Saturday with a campaign of terror on their doorstep. Like 
Evans, they are as not used to being the victims as they are to losing. Both 
are hard to comprehend. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Business as usual 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">It will take some getting used to. Somehow the attack on the Olympics 
establishes a pattern, a routine of violence that is familiar elsewhere. The 
determination of the International 
Olympic Committee and the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG) to 
carry on the Games as usual cannot conceal that the future must be business as 
unusual. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Where next? The final of the World Series this autumn? The Super Bowl next 
January? Disneyworld? The Statue of Liberty? Bloomingdales and Central Park? 
There are many targets for the potential terrorist, more symbols of the 
American way of life than just the White House. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Already President Bill Clinton has warned that internal airport security will 
be stepped up and that this will mean longer queues and more expensive air 
fares. But a metal detector to meet Mickey Mouse? And the only thing most 
American shops want to know about the contents of their customers' bags is the 
number on their credit cards. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Atlanta thought it was prepared. There were bomb squads at every site and a 
system of passes and accreditation 
so ruthlessly effective that at times it almost threatened to paralyse the 
Games. But the rock concert that was the target of the bombers was outside the 
inner ring of steel, a free event for the ordinary fan to enjoy, to dance and 
to swap pin badges. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Even though a security guard spotted the knapsack with the device within 
minutes, even though police had already begun to clear the area, it was already 
too late. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">As London and Belfast have long discovered, you only 
<strong>identify</strong> your loopholes by bitter experience. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The U.S. fears terrorism, but it has not lived with it. Faced with the prospect 
of the IRA in the cities of Britain, the tourists take off their Burberry 
raincoats and stay in Kansas. The first rattle of shot in the Gulf War was 
enough to frighten the Hollywood tough guys from the Cannes film festival. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Many Americans do not 
venture abroad at all, where the food is funny and the air conditioning never 
works. They prefer to experience the world secondhand. They can walk the Great 
Wall of China in Florida, see the Cathedral of Notre Dame while munching 
popcorn and slurping Coke at their local theatre. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">U.S. learning a less 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The sense of superiority that romanticizes the IRA as freedom fighters and 
pours dollars into Dublin may now seem less certain. The U.S. is learning the 
lesson of cause and effect, particularly in Israel. Foreign adventures can 
sometimes bring back unwanted souvenirs. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Somehow the U.S. always seemed safe, an island in an uncomfortable world. From 
time to time --two world wars, Korea, Bosnia -- it can ride out like John 
Wayne, but always return to shut the gates of the fortress.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Such disasters that befall its 
citizens are mostly acts of God or nature: tornadoes, hurricanes, blizzards and 
floods. Even the other hazards were homegrown: the car and the air crash, the 
right to bear arms. A reporter interviewing doctors at the hospital where many 
of the bomb victims were taken was told that the casualty toll was no worse 
than for a typical Friday night. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">These things are part of life. Terrorism is not. And the U.S. brand seems to be 
a particularly virulent strain. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">At least the British Government knows that the IRA wants a united Ireland when 
it lays waste a Manchester shopping centre. It can seek to negotiate, to move 
on from the gun to the ballot box. Likewise the atrocities of ETA and the Tamil 
Tigers may be mindless, but not motiveless. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The threat to the U.S. is still nameless and faceless. Probably it is revenge. 
No one has yet claimed responsibility 
for Atlanta, nor, if it proves to be terrorism bomb, TWA Flight 800. The 
identity of the World Trade Centre and Oklahoma City bombers was known only 
because they were caught, the result of good detective work and luck. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Difficult task ahead 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The U.S. is likely to need a great deal more of both, although prevention is 
more likely than cure. Suspicion almost immediately falls on the Arab world. 
And while far-right fanatics and militiamen are also a possibility, it should 
be remembered that the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> was neither. Finding those responsible will not be easy. This is a nation of 
foreigners as much as it is of nut cases. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>Witnesses</strong> to the explosion at the Games seemed confused by the flash and noise, the 
rapidly fading plume of smoke. Some thought it was a pyrotechnic stunt to end 
the rock concert. Others that it was fireworks or lightning. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">No one is likely to make the 
same mistake next time. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">An age of innocence is over.
