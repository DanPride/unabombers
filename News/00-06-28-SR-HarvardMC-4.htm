Atlantic Monthly
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Fascinating cover story suggests that the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> was actually born at Harvard, which gave Ted Kaczynski his first taste of 
higher education. Story notes that Kaczynski, who was 16 when he arrived in 
Cambridge, Mass., was the subject of a brutal series of psychological tests 
that may have started him down the road to mental illness. His anti-technology 
bent also may have formed there as a reaction to curriculum that preached that 
science was the one true belief and faith and morality were just window 
dressing. It's interesting to note that the piece is written by Alston Chase, a 
Harvard graduate and mathematician who, like Kaczynski, moved to the Montana 
wilderness in the early 1970s. Another story calls White working class males 
the 'forgotten majority.&quot;

Long piece questions the actions of Desert Storm Gen. Barry McCaffrey,
noting that his 24th Infantry Division attacked a line of retreating Iraqi
vehicles and troops for several hours with hardly any response from the
Iraqis. The attack came two days after the cease-fire, and officers and
enlisted men interviewed later said there was little or no Iraqi fire at all.
Piece also notes that McCaffrey's troops also opened fire on unarmed prisoners
near a hospital bus, though McCaffrey, who is now President Clinton's drug
czar, was not on the scene. The story was written by Seymour M. Hersh, who
conducted hundreds of interviews. In a fun read, Edward Hoagland writes a
memoir of the time he literally ran away and joined the circus.

Tycoon
We have to admit we were hoping for 
a how-to guide with this one, but
instead we got a dopey feature on Greg Norman. 'Greg Norman is his name, and
golf is his game,&quot; the story opines. Wow. Point of the story seems to be that
Norman has made a lot of money selling his shark clothes and building golf
courses hither and yon. He also gets around in style, owning a Gulfstream jet,
a helicopter, a boat, three Harleys, two Jet Skis and a partridge in a pear
tree. OK, we made that last one up. They also pin down filmmaker Francis Ford
Coppola for a Q-and-A and quiz him about wine. This is the guy who directed
The Godfather, and we're asking him about grapes? Yee-ipes. The magazine also
advises that 'buying a private isle can be hard work, but the rewards are well
worth it.&quot;

Vanity Fair
In kind of a neat feature, writer/director Cameron Crowe interviews Tom
Cruise, whom Crowe directed in the smash hit Jerry Maguire. The magazine is a
little overwrought about this, calling the Q-and-A style piece 
&quot;two days of
soul-searching interviews.&quot; If you say so. Cruise searches his soul and
reveals that it was really fun flying those airplanes in Top Gun. He also says
these words, about the kabillion of dollars he's making, with a straight face,
'I get paid because I'm worth it and they should pay me that much. But I've
never worked for money, ever.&quot; The piece offers a nice bit of retrospective
on Cruise's career. There's also an interesting excerpt from a new book by
cyclist Lance Armstrong, who beat cancer to win the 1999 Tour de 
France.
