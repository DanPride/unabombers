</p><p class="body" align="Left">An explosives expert disarmed a package of pipe bombs sent to a doctor who came 
within a hair of setting off a potentially fatal explosion.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">No one was arrested, and federal investigators said yesterday there was no 
initial evidence to link the attempted attack to the 
&quot;<strong>Unabomber,</strong>&quot; a serial bomber who has killed one person and injured 23 since 1978.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Dr. Paul Rosenberg began to open the package after returning home from a 
vacation late Sunday, said Police Chief Jay Tedesco. He and his wife fled the 
house and called authorities after he saw wires coming out of the package.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Had Rosenberg peeled the package open another eighth of an inch there would 
have been an explosion, said Mike Costello, who disarmed the bomb.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Rosenberg, a neurologist at Children's Hospital in Boston, told police he had 
no idea why anyone would want to kill him.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> has struck off and on around the country since 1978, generally targeting 
university professors and people from the airline and computer industries.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The most recent bombs thought to be the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> work were mailed earlier this year to professors at the University of 
California at San Francisco and Yale University in New Haven, Conn. In October 
authorities offered a $1 million reward for help in a case that has stymied 
investigators.
