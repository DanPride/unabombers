Federal law enforcement officials said Friday that they are
&quot;very, very certain&quot; the two bombs that injured professors at UC San
Francisco and Yale University this week are the work of a terrorist who has
re-emerged from a six-year hiatus after 12 similar bombings from 1978 to 1987. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
&quot;The forensic experts believe . . . that the maker or makers of each of
these 14 explosive devices is the same person or persons,&quot; Milton
Ahlerich, the FBI's special agent in Connecticut, said at a New Haven news
conference. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
&quot;It's been a long time since we heard from him -- or them,&quot; Jim
Cavanaugh, deputy chief of the explosives division of the U.S. Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, added in Washington. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Officials said they also suspect that the bomber may have strong ties in
California, particularly Sacramento, where the only fatality caused by the
bombs occurred in 1985. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Both bombs this week were sent through the mail and bore Sacramento postmarks
-- as was a boastful letter sent to the New York Times that was apparently
written by the perpetrator, officials said. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
The latest victim, David Gelernter, 38, a Yale associate professor of computer
science was injured Thursday when he opened a package in his office. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Two days earlier, UC San Francisco geneticist Charles Epstein, 59, lost several
fingers and suffered burns, cuts and injuries to his chest, abdomen and face
when he opened a parcel in the kitchen of his home in Tiburon, on the north
side of San Francisco Bay. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
<a id="FCPin"></a>
Investigators have not talked at length to either victim because of their
conditions. Epstein's medical condition was upgraded to stable, but he remains
hospitalized. Gelernter was still on a respirator Friday, recovering from
surgery. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">

Law enforcement authorities said they are sure of the link
between this week's bombings and the earlier 12 because of the use of the
initials &quot;FC&quot; in the June 21 letter to the New York Times. The same
initials had been crudely scratched onto some of the earlier bombs, sources
said. </a>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
&quot;We don't know what that means, but it's the first time that it's been put
out there by someone claiming responsibility,&quot; Cavanaugh said, referring
to the letter, which identified its author or authors as &quot;an anarchist
group calling ourselves FC.&quot; 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Ahlerich urged professors and scientists across the country to be wary of
suspicious parcels, saying that, on average, the explosives have come in
packages that measure roughly 8 inches by 11 inches and are 2- to
3-inches-thick. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Some of the bombs were mailed, often with excess postage, but others were
simply left at the scene, officials noted. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">
Forensic experts believe that the bombs are linked because they all had the
same &quot;unique&quot; qualities, said Rick Smith, an FBI spokesman in San
Francisco.</span> 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
<b>&quot;The bombs really show an
obsessive attention on the part of the maker to the way various components
work,&quot; added Christopher Ronay, chief of the FBI's explosives unit in
Washington, who has investigated the bombings since 1982.</b><span

</p><p class="body" align="Left">
At one point during the 1980s, some investigators referred to the perpetrator
as the &quot;Junkyard Bomber&quot; because of a tendency to fashion components
from makeshift materials and scrap, according to retired Sacramento Sheriff's
Lt. Ray Biondi, who investigated the Dec. 11, 1985, bombing death of Hugh
Scrutton, 38. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Scrutton, the owner of a computer rental store near Sacramento State
University, picked up a burlap bag in the alley behind the store, setting off
an explosive device. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Tensions ran high Friday at UC San Francisco. Police Chief Ron Nelson canceled
days off for all 25 of his patrol officers, and flyers advising caution were
distributed to all university departments. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
In one incident, a parcel that appeared suspicious was received by an
unidentified university official, who called authorities. The San Francisco
Police Department's bomb squad was brought in, but the package merely contained
a manuscript. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
&quot;Everyone is on edge,&quot; said one researcher. &quot;We're trying not to
let it affect our lives, but that doesn't seem possible quite yet.&quot; 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
UC Berkeley -- site of two earlier bombing incidents -- was also on
&quot;heightened alert,&quot; according to campus spokesman Bob Sanders. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Investigators said the latest bombings caught them by surprise because they had
presumed that after six years of silence, the bomber had died, gone to jail for
other crimes or given up. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
There had been gaps of up to three years between previous bombings, so the case
had not been abandoned, officials said. A federal task force continued to meet
about once a year, the most recent such session taking place in a San Francisco
hotel last summer. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
&quot;During the past two or three years, the passage of time caused
investigators to presume that something had caused the person to stop,&quot;
said one investigator. &quot;But he is back.&quot; 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
In all, 21 people were injured in the previous string of bombings, which
included incidents on the campuses of the University of Illinois-Chicago in
1978, Northwestern University in 1979, Vanderbilt University in 1982, UC
Berkeley in 1982 and 1985 and the University of Michigan in 1985. A similar
explosive device was found, but safely defused, in a University of Utah
classroom in 1981. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
FBI officials in San Francisco said law enforcement officials refer to the
incidents as <strong>UNABOM,</strong> which stands for United Airlines Bomb --
a reference to a June 10, 1980, mail bombing that injured United Airlines
President Percy Wood at his Lake Forest, Ill., home. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Two other incidents also involved the airline industry. On Nov. 15, 1979, a
parcel detonated in the cargo bay of an American Airlines flight from Chicago
to Dulles International Airport outside Washington. About a dozen passengers
were treated for smoke inhalation after the plane made an emergency landing. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Investigation of that incident caused officials to recognize the similarity of
the airplane bomb and the first two bombs, at the University of Illinois and
Northwestern, Ronay said. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
In addition, a package mailed in 1985 to the Boeing Co. in Auburn, Wash., was
found and defused. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
A big potential break in the bombings came on Feb. 20, 1987, when a witness saw
a man setting a burlap bag down near a parked car in a Salt Lake City parking
lot. Before the witness could investigate, another passerby picked up the bag
and a bomb went off. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Authorities developed a sketch of the suspect based on a description provided
by the witness, but there were no more bombing incidents until this week. The
description of the suspect: a medium-build white man with reddish-blond hair
and a thin mustache. Authorities suspect that the bomber &quot;perhaps stays
around to see the results,&quot; Ronay said. &quot;It's something bombers tend
to do.&quot; 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Officials said they have not developed any strong possible motives for the
bombings, or any credible theories to explain the hiatus. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
&quot;It's anybody's guess,&quot; Ronay said. &quot;But we believe that his
selection of targets may depend on his state of mind.&quot; 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Added Cavanaugh: &quot;Maybe he was incarcerated or somehow not available.
Maybe he was overseas. Or in a hospital. Maybe he was just happy.&quot; 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Ahlerich said: &quot;International terrorism is not on the top of the
list&quot; of suspected motives. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
By Friday, several hundred federal agents, assisted by state and local law
enforcement officials, joined the search, rejuvenating the UNABOMB task force.
