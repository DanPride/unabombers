making mayhem with a plan

</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong> 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">WINDSOR, Ont. -- A Web site used to marshall the forces of mayhem for this 
weekend's meeting of the Organization of American States reveals both the 
threat and the limits of the new anarchism. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Infoshop News Kiosk -- ''anarchist, activist and alternative news'' -- 
includes a call to shut down the Windsor meeting where foreign ministers will 
discuss a continent-wide free trade agreement. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''The experiences gained in Seattle and Washington will help our struggle 
against global capitalism remain autonomous, democratic and effective,'' the 
missive on www.infoshop.org begins. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''However, experience has also shown that our effectiveness is only limited to 
the organizational cohesion of affinity (protest) groups. We cannot stress the 
importance of meeting regularly with your affinity groups frequently before you 
come to Windsor.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Organizers ask the groups to answer a few essential questions online: How many 
are you? What level of risk/confrontation does your affinity group represent? 
How many arrestibles are in your group? Is there anything other affinity groups 
should know about your group or your intentions? 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">They conclude with an apology of sorts for such an unseemly imposition of 
order: ''We realize this sounds like a very centralized process, but we're 
trying to facilitate autonomous co-ordination, and are always open to any 
suggestions.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Once assigned to the quiet shelves of history, anarchists are back on the march 
and in the news. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Their long-dormant philosophy -- and its emphasis on empowering the individual 
-- has breathed intellectual energy and destructive force into protest 
movements worldwide. Curiously, it is anarchism that has provided the glue 
between fringe elements of the environmental, anti-trade, animal rights, labour 
and 
anti-poverty movements. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Although they may be difficult to organize and direct, these are anarchists 
with a cause. The disruptive power of the free- form radicals was on display at 
the World Trade Organization's gathering in Seattle and, to a lesser degree, at 
the April meeting of the International Monetary Fund in Washington. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Starting tomorrow, the City of Windsor will confront these same spirited and 
fleet-footed opponents of corporate power and state authority. Calgary, host of 
this year's World Petroleum Congress, faces them next week. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">As the radicals ready themselves, police officials and politicians are still 
trying to assess the threat they pose and agree on appropriate 
counter-measures. Should these protesters be ignored or engaged? Should they be 
infiltrated, welcomed, annihilated or embraced? 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Organizing the Anarchists 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Jaggi Singh and Genny Santos canvass door-to-door in downtown Windsor, four 
days before the mayhem is scheduled to 
begin. Self- described anarchists, they're trying to spread their 
anti-corporate message among the city's working class and win recruits to their 
cause. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">It's tough going, though, as the reputation of these radicals precedes them. 
The rampage in Seattle cost businesses there $<strong></strong>17 million. The people of Windsor are on edge. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The city has barricaded a downtown city block with chain-link fences anchored 
in concrete; businesses have started to board up their windows; and some 2,000 
police officers -- including Toronto's mounted crowd- control unit -- are 
preparing for the worst. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mr. Singh, 27, and Ms. Santos, 22, organizers with the OAS Shutdown Coalition, 
insist that their presence here is misunderstood. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''Windsor is a working-class town: we're not targeting the city; we're 
targeting the OAS,'' says Mr. Singh, who played a key role in the 1997 
APEC summit protests in Vancouver. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''This idea that we'd come to trash the city is just horrible,'' he says. ''I 
don't think you'll see any of that.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Yet when he's pressed, Mr. Singh admits he can't say for sure what will happen 
since the coalition's primary job has been to attract so-called affinity groups 
to Windsor. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The affinity groups -- like- minded people committed to the same brand of 
disorder -- are expected to decide for themselves what they'll do during this 
weekend's protest. Some will perform street theatre, others are expected to 
scale buildings. Still others may decide to heave rocks through store windows. 
It's all part of what the new radicals call ''direct action.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''People are tired of having rallies where they walk around in circles and 
don't have any kind of impact, '' says Ms. Santos, a University of Toronto 
political science graduate. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Direct action, she says, affords individuals the chance to alter the workings 
of unelected and hugely powerful organizations, such as the WTO, the World Bank 
and the OAS. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''We say that they're the problem,'' says Mr. Singh, ''and we're not going to 
accommodate ourselves to the problem. We're going to confront it directly.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In keeping with the anarchist model of organization -- and yes, Mr. Singh 
insists, there is such a beast -- there's no leader, nor is there an official 
spokesman for the OAS protest. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Each affinity group acts for itself, but is supposed to send an emissary -- or 
''spoke'' -- to the planning council, which passes on vital information about 
potential strategies and targets for direct action. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The anarchist structure makes it easy for radicals of all stripes to feel 
comfortable in the same formless tent. But it means the messages that emanate 
from 
protests like this one are muddled and often lost on observers who 
understandably view them as anti-everything. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''There's this idea that we're professional protesters, and you can use that 
term if you want, but it comes from a political perspective: the idea that this 
is a bigger struggle,'' says Mr. Singh. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''If it's a blockade to save forests, if it's standing up for low-income 
housing, or fighting against police brutality or brutality in prisons, they're 
all tied together. They're all part of the capitalist system.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In many ways, the message is the mayhem. It's meant to remind everyone that the 
authorities are not in control. And indeed, the organizational structure 
reflects that goal since neither Mr. Singh nor anyone else is sure what's going 
to happen. No one knows if or when the first bottle will be thrown -- or how to 
stop the violence should it 
escalate. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''We can't predict what anyone is going to do, but you should also ask that of 
the police. I can't control what they're going to do,'' says Mr. Singh. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In Washington, Seattle and at the APEC summit in Vancouver, he insists, it was 
the police that unleashed the physical violence. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">But the police must protect property against anarchists, many of whom do not 
regard property damage as violence. It makes clashes of some kind seemingly 
inevitable. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''If you had property downtown and someone was destroying it, you'd expect us 
to do something about it,'' says Windsor police Staff Sgt. Dave Rossell. 
''We'll do everything we can to protect property ... We're prepared for the 
worst, but hoping for the best.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">For their part, protest organizers are also prepared for most eventualities. 
Affinity groups have been warned to come equipped with mineral water and 
alcohol swabs to defend against 
pepper spray. Legal and medical teams have been assembled. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''We're not giving anybody any orders,'' says Mr.  Singh in rejecting a 
suggestion that anarchist organizers are, in effect, the puppet masters of 
disaster. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''We're giving people all the power and tools they need to be effective. That's 
not a form of control, that's a form of empowerment. We've set up a stage where 
people can express themselves as affinity groups.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">One Man's Anarchy 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">It turns out that even anti- corporate anarchists appreciate their Tim Hortons. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Jaggi Singh orders a medium double-double and a cruller before he sits down to 
explain what it means to be an anarchist today. ''I'm not too caught up in the 
label,'' Mr. Singh says, ''but I'm not ashamed to say I'm anarchist.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">At the 
University of British Columbia, Mr. Singh helped organize the APEC 
demonstrations and gained national notoriety when he was arrested in advance of 
the protest on flimsy charges that were eventually dropped. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''When you start to challenge authority, then you're a radical,'' he says. 
''But I think we have to encourage people to become radicals. That's how things 
are really going to change.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Like any of today's committed anarchists, Mr. Singh wants to tear down the 
instruments of globalization -- APEC, OAS, WTO, IMF -- organizations that 
extend the reach and power of capitalism. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">He insists he's not against global trade that promises to improve the lot of 
workers in poor countries, but he is against a system that places corporations 
and their interests ahead of all other interests such as human rights, poverty 
or nature. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''They've taken trade and made it an idol,'' he says. ''Somehow to oppose it 
means you're 
nuts, like you're opposed to gravity.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">His mother, a nurse, and his father, a cab driver, came to Canada from India 
before he was born. His mother is quietly supportive of his activism, but would 
prefer it if he pursued his PhD or law degree. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''She obviously would prefer that I settled down,'' says Mr. Singh, who makes 
ends meet by writing for the alternative press in Montreal. ''But she sees that 
I'm satisfied with what I'm doing. And for now, she says she just wants to make 
sure if my photo is taken that I'm clean-shaven.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">'a Ride Into the Unknown' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">For much of the past 60 years, the currents of anarchism crackled softly in the 
relative obscurity of coffee houses and university campuses. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">That changed suddenly in May 1995, when the New York Times and Washington Post 
published the 35,000-word political manifesto of 
a mysterious domestic terrorist known only as the 
<strong>Unabomber.</strong> Its publication would lead to the arrest of mathematics professor Ted 
Kaczynski -- his brother recognized the tract and informed the FBI -- and 
provide inspiration to radical anarchists worldwide. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mr. Kaczynski crystallized the radical case against technology -- he said it 
exacerbates the corporate control of people's lives and speeds the destruction 
of nature -- and offered a defence of violence as the only means to alter 
society's path. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''The technophiles are taking us all on an utterly reckless ride into the 
unknown, '' the Harvard-educated Mr. Kaczynski wrote. He said the system is so 
entrenched that it cannot be changed, only destroyed by revolutionaries like 
the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> who ''by hastening the onset of the breakdown will be reducing the extent of 
the disaster.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The manifesto won the admiration of John Zerzan, a Eugene, Oregon-based writer, 
whose prison visits with Mr. 
Kaczynski affirmed the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> status as an anarchist icon. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mr. Zerzan, 56, is considered one of the most influential of today's anarchist 
thinkers. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A political science graduate from Stanford University who also holds a master's 
degree in history, Mr. Zerzan has produced an influential series of essays in 
which he denounces consumerism and technology as contemporary forms of slavery. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''The more high-tech society becomes, the more it tends to flatten 
experience,'' he wrote. ''People sit in front of a screen and life becomes 
emptier and emptier.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Like the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> he equates progress with ''ecological collapse and the near-complete 
dehumanization of the individual. '' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Unlike the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> though, Mr. Zerzan equivocates about the use of violence to bring about a 
kinder, simpler society based on the classic anarchist model: small, 
independent communities that operate without 
elected leaders. He believes that peaceful civil uprisings, like the ones that 
led to the collapse of the Soviet East bloc, can effect the kind of freedom he 
seeks.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">That view puts Mr. Zerzan in what might be called the mainstream of radical 
anarchism. Old school anarchists, like writer Chaz Bufe, maintain that the 
movement must be based on an ethical, non-violent approach lest one form of 
oppression replace another. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">More radical factions believe that words and peaceful protests have 
accomplished nothing in recent years. They believe it's necessary to inflict 
damage on the corporations that extend the reach of global trade and technology 
at the expense of the Earth and its poorest citizens. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''Politicians and companies ignore letters, petitions and public inquiries,'' 
the Earth First! Web site at www.k2net.co.uk/ef/efhtmls/ 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">introduction.html 
exhorts. ''They reject overwhelming evidence because it goes against their 
interests. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''Conventional campaigns are all too often narrow and are seen as single 
issues. The scale of change needed is forgotten.  While the world burns, 
environmentalists debate recycling.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Earth First! argues the situation is so dire that people must take matters into 
their own hands ''and physically halt the further destruction of nature.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">And increasingly, radical fringe elements are doing just that. Last year, FBI 
director Louis Freeh told a U.S. Senate subcommittee on domestic terrorism that 
''the most recognizable single issue of terrorists at the present time are 
those involved in the violent animal rights, anti-abortion and environmental 
protection movements.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Portland Oregonian last year identified 100 significant acts of destruction 
on the West Coast since 1980 linked to ecoterrorists, or radical animal rights 
groups, such as the Animal Liberation Front. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A century ago, the individual acts of anarchists caused serious political 
havoc: anarchist assassins claimed as their victims President Sadi Carnot of 
France (1894), Empress Elizabeth of Austria (1898), King Umberto of Italy 
(1900), and President William McKinley of the United States (1901). 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">But today, the new anarchists are using numbers to wage mayhem. In Windsor, as 
the city awaits the OAS shutdown attempt, the police are still guessing at 
those numbers. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''We don't know if it's going to be 2, 000 or 20,000,'' says Staff Sgt. 
Rossell. ''And from what I can tell, I don't think the protest organizers know 
either.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Chaos Games 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Jaggi Singh says he doesn't consider it a violent act to heave a rock through 
the window of a Gap Store or a Wal-Mart since 
it doesn't harm other people. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''The prospect of violence from us, no matter how you define it, is so minimal 
and marginal compared to the violence perpetrated in the name of global free 
trade,'' he argues. ''Poverty is a form of violence, prisons are violence. 
Putting some graffiti on McDonald's is farcical by comparison.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Although he doesn't embrace Mr. Kaczynski's extremism, Mr. Singh says he 
believes the trashing of Seattle stores during the WTO protest was an effective 
form of direct action. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''The way they did it, they didn't put anyone else at risk, except themselves. 
They targeted Wal-Mart, Nike, Starbucks. These are symbols of a culture that, 
as my friend (APEC protester) Rob West says, 'looks like Disney, tastes like 
Coke and smells like shit.' '' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''There's this boredom out there,'' he continues, ''which even the people in 
the 
suburbs can relate to: the feeling that there must be something more to life 
than buying into mutual funds.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">For Mr. Singh, life is now about organizing anarchists and other radicals who 
share his views on the evils of big business and big trade deals. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">He rattles off a series of upcoming international meetings: the World Petroleum 
Congress in Calgary, the International Monetary Fund in Prague, the Asian 
Development Bank in Thailand. Each of the big meetings -- they're like the 
Olympics for protesters, Mr. Singh says -- will draw radicals intent on 
disrupting their business. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Windsor is expected to be a small event by comparison. Mr. Singh calls it a 
warm-up for a meeting next April in Quebec City known as the Summit of the 
Americas, in which 34 leaders will 
discuss the proposed continental free trade deal. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">He warns that the chaos games in Quebec City will be nothing less than 
''huge.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''It's going to be like Seattle and Washington. They're just crazy to try to 
hold it in Quebec City. It's a challenge to us, a slap in the face. Why would 
they hold it in that city when they know we're going to mobilize thousands to 
shut it down? It's crazy.''
