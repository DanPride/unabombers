<p class="body" align="Left">AN FBI sketch of the man known as 
&quot;<strong>Unabomber&quot;</strong> was posted around America with a $ 1 million reward yesterday as more than 100 
detectives assembled into a new task force briefed to catch a serial bomber who 
has evaded them for 16 years. The picture is the one clue to the bomber who 
detectives are convinced killed Mr Thomas Mosser with a parcel bomb delivered 
to his New Jersey home. Mr Mosser, 50, a senior executive of the Young and 
Rubicam advertising agency, who returned to New York from a posting in London 
this year, was the second fatality in a bombing campaign which has injured 23 
others. But the FBI admits that it is little closer to laying a hand on 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> than it was when his first parcel bomb exploded in 1978. 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> first targets were airlines and 
universities, which prompted the FBI to tag the case Unabomb. The sketch 
depicts a man in his 30s or 40s, with reddish-blond hair, a moustache and a 
strong jaw-line. He is shown with his head covered by a jogging-suit hood and 
wearing dark glasses. This is the man as described by a woman shortly before 
one of the explosions. There has been no other sighting of 
<strong>Unabomber.</strong> The bomb that killed Mr Mosser was described as the most powerful to date. 
Slipped into a parcel about the size of hardback book, it blew a two-foot-deep 
crater below the kitchen counter where Mr Mosser opened it, and nearly 
decapitated him.  
The link between all his victims so far is their involvement with 
high-technology, either in industry or in universities. Young and Rubicam has 
recently taken on major contracts with two of the country's top hi-tech 
companies, Digital Equipment Corporation and the Xerox Corporation. Between 
1987 and last year there was a lull in the attacks; 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> may have been in jail. But in June last year, the New York Times received a 
letter warning of a 
&quot;newsworthy event&quot;, signed by 
&quot;an anarchist group calling ourselves FC&quot;. The initials FC, thought to be an obscene reference to computers, have been 
found in the debris of the bombs. Shortly afterwards, two scientists were 
injured by almost identical bombs: Mr Charles Epstein, a geneticist at the 
University of California lost several fingers as he opened a 
parcel; two days later Mr David Gelerther, a Yale computer scientist, was 
seriously injured. Detectives believe 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> basic motive is a Luddite reaction to modern technology: he may, for instance, 
have lost a job to a computer. But the unpredictability of his targets has 
wrong-footed them. Yesterday, major companies and universities were taking all 
security measures possible amid the Christmas postal rush, particularly since 
police say that 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> has a pattern of striking twice. 
&quot;There's a good bit of anxiety, understandably. We've been taking a lot of calls,&quot; said Mr Robert McGuire, president of Kroll Associates, the security 
consultants. The one-man terror campaign has left a jigsaw with hundreds of 
pieces, but few clues as to how they should go together. Mr Jim Freeman, the 
FBI special agent in charge of the 
San Francisco office leading the hunt, said: 
&quot;We have been using computer support to pull together millions of bits of 
information. When everything comes together, it will seem so obvious.&quot; The San Francisco Bay area is thought to be 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> principal stamping ground because at least eight of his 15 attacks have some 
link with the area. The bomb that killed Mr Mosser held evidence, like others, 
of being posted from the area. The FBI knows 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> best through his bombs which have become increasingly sophisticated and 
powerful. Their unique stamp lies in the craftsmanship of their construction. 
The wood used in the cases is polished to a high sheen, springs are cunningly 
coiled by hand from paper clips and even the half-inch screws he uses are 
hand-made. The FBI believes 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> is now motivated mainly by a maniacal pride in his bomb-making.
