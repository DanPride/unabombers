</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> By DAN MORAIN and JENIFER WARREN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>DATELINE:</strong> SACRAMENTO 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A mysterious serial bomber linked to 15 attacks that have left two people dead 
and 22 injured since 1978 apparently struck again Monday, killing a lobbyist 
with a pipe bomb concealed in an innocuous-looking package mailed to his office.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Richard Ross, Sacramento's FBI special agent in charge, said a 
&quot;preliminary assessment of some of the materials&quot; at the scene of the bombing just four blocks from the state Capitol 
&quot;strongly indicates&quot; it was the work of the serial attacker known as 
<strong>Unabomber.</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;A very meticulous effort is being made to acquire any and all evidence that may 
help us put an end to this string of malicious and horrible bombings,&quot; Ross said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Monday's explosion took the life of Gilbert Murray, president of a timber 
industry group called the California Forestry Assn. Murray, 
47, of suburban Roseville, was a married father of three and a licensed 
forester who had worked for the association for about eight years.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Ross said the pipe bomb -- contained in a heavy package about the size of a 
shoe box -- was addressed to another individual at the forestry association. He 
would not identify that person, nor say whether the package carried a return 
address or other identifiable markings.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">FBI officials described the bomb as a 
&quot;powerful device&quot; that caused a small fire and extensive damage to the association's office in a 
one-story brick building in the heart of downtown Sacramento.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Tari Sessions, a secretary in a law office behind the building, said she heard 
&quot;a big crash&quot; that sounded like two train cars hooking up.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I said, 'Oh my God, what happened,' and I stood up, ran out and saw all the 
smoke,&quot; recalled Sessions, whose office was rocked by the blast. 
&quot;It was too 
close for comfort.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;It blew doors out; it blew windows out,&quot; said Sacramento Fire Department Division Chief Jan Dunbar. 
&quot;There's a lot of debris in the hallway. . . . There's glass and ceiling tiles 
on the floor.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno said Monday's explosion would receive the highest 
priority by the Justice Department. Over the past 17 years, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> has been blamed for attacks that have killed two people -- now a third -- and 
injured 22. Murray was the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> second Sacramento victim. The first was a computer store owner, Hugh Scrutton, 
38, who was killed in 1985 by a parcel bomb he found in a parking lot outside 
his store.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Three other victims also were from Northern California, but the bomber has 
struck from coast to coast, in the Midwest, the South and 
twice in Utah. The 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> last known victim was a New Jersey advertising executive killed by a mail bomb 
in December, 1994.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">When the first Sacramento bombing occurred, detectives thought they were 
dealing with a 
&quot;local, revenge-type crime,&quot; recalled Ray Biondi, a retired Sacramento County Sheriff's Department homicide 
lieutenant who investigated the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> first murder.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;We soon found it was part of a series that had been going since 1978,&quot; Biondi said. 
&quot;Initially, we didn't have any strong theories about Sacramento. We thought he 
maybe was passing through.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But a 1993 letter from the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> had a Sacramento postmark. Now, with the second killing here, and given that 
other bombings have occurred in Northern California, 
&quot;there probably is a strong Sacramento connection,&quot; Biondi said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Last year, a $1-million 
reward was posted for information leading to the Unabomer's arrest. But no 
suspects have been turned up, despite the efforts of a federal task force based 
in San Francisco. The FBI has established a special hot line for tips related 
to the 
<strong>Unabomber.</strong> The number is (800) 701-BOMB.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">FBI agents have sketched a composite of a suspect after a man was seen placing 
two 2-by-4 boards with protruding nails in the parking lot outside a Salt Lake 
City computer store. He was wearing a hooded sweat shirt and dark glasses, and 
was described as 5 feet, 10 inches tall and weighing 165 pounds with light hair.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">FBI officials dubbed the series of attacks Unabom, which represents a 
combination of two of the bomber's favorite targets universities and airlines. 
One target was 
a president of United Airlines, and several have been university professors.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Monday's explosion occurred shortly after 2 p.m. when a clerical worker for the 
forestry association delivered the package -- sent through the mail and wrapped 
in brown paper -- to Murray in the building near 13th and I streets, police 
said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bomb exploded immediately, killing Murray. There were five other people in 
the office, but no other injuries were reported. A pregnant woman was taken to 
a hospital as a precaution and released, police said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Outside the building, police roped off a block-long section of roadway as 
authorities prowled for clues. The team of investigators includes the U.S. 
Postal Service, the FBI, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, 
the state Fire Marshal's Office and local fire and police officials.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Gov. Pete 
Wilson condemned the bombing and said he was working with the State Police to 
ensure that all state facilities are protected by 
&quot;maximum security.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;A civilized society cannot tolerate these sorts of heinous actions, and we will 
bring all forces to bear to see that the perpetrator or perpetrators of this 
crime are swiftly brought to justice,&quot; Wilson said in a statement.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The explosion came less than a week after the blast at the Alfred P. Murrah 
Federal Building in Oklahoma City, which killed at least 83 people and left 
about 150 missing.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Dana Santiago, a construction worker who was standing in the street about 25 
yards from the scene of the Sacramento blast, said his mind raced to the 
Oklahoma City tragedy after he heard a thundering boom and then saw a woman 
stagger out of the forestry association building.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;We thought, 'Oh (no), somebody set off a bomb,' 
&quot; Santiago said. Because he is working on a new high-rise scheduled to house the 
state attorney general, Santiago said he feared that the blast might have been 
the work of anti-government extremists like those accused in the Oklahoma 
attack.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Since the Oklahoma City thing, it's been on our minds that it could happen here,&quot; Santiago said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The California Forestry Assn. is a nonprofit trade group that lobbies on behalf 
of wood products companies and commercial forest landowners. In 1993, it filed 
an unsuccessful petition asking the federal government to remove the northern 
spotted owl from the endangered species list.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Lobbyists and others familiar with forestry issues said 1995 has been a quiet 
year on the timber front, with most of the legislation focusing on minor 
procedural changes in forest 
regulations.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Friends of Murray described him as a highly professional lobbyist who was a 
determined advocate for timber companies but displayed a low-key, affable style.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;It's crazy. It's like the missile hit the wrong target,&quot; said former state Sen. Barry Keene, who represented the North Coast during his 
years in the Legislature and worked on many timber-related bills. 
&quot;You might not agree with his point of view, but he was not extreme in any sense 
of the word.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Teresa A. Davies, a lobbyist who worked for the forestry association until a 
year ago and now works for Louisiana Pacific Timber Co., said Davies 
&quot;was just real honorable and down to earth.&quot; He enjoyed spending his off hours coaching Little League and joining his 
children at 
school activities, she said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Murray's relatives declined to comment.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Many of the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> attacks have been on people who are in some way involved in computers. But the 
Unabom devices also have components related to wood. The bases are wooden, and 
fictional return addresses have been Spruce or Elm streets, or some other tree.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In addition, one of his victims was named Wood, and his target in December, a 
New Jersey advertising executive, lived on Aspen Drive.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Brian M. Jenkins, a terrorism expert and deputy chairman of the investigative 
firm, Kroll Associates, called the latest victim 
&quot;somewhat of a shift in target.&quot; But he noted that based on the construction of the bombs, wood may have 
&quot;some personal meaning to him.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In recent times, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> has placed his initials on the devices, which are built with painstaking care, 
often from what seemingly are pieces of junk. 
Officials at Monday's bombing said there were small holes in the walls, an 
indication that the bomb was filled with metal fragments and designed to kill.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Monday's bombing comes on the heels of three bomb-related incidents in Nevada 
in the past month, all aimed against structures of the U.S. Forest Service. No 
one was injured in the explosions and authorities have turned up no motives or 
suspects, Forest Service spokeswoman Erin O'Connor said.
