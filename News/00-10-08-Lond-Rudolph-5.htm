at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, he triggered the country's biggest ever 
manhunt. But despite sightings and the Dollars 1m on his head, he's so far 
managed to elude capture. Nick Paton Walsh travels to the Cherokee forest of 
Nantahala and joins the bounty hunters 



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> Nick Paton Walsh 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Under the triple canopy of the Nantahala forest of North Carolina it is 
impossible to see a man 10ft away. In Cherokee the word Nantahala means the 
'land of the midday sun'. It is a place that rarely cools below 30degreesC in 
summer, that generates a cacophony of sounds - the screech of bobcats and the 
maddening static of the insects that begin their assault at dusk and continue 
until first light. The undergrowth throws out tangled roots to trip the unwary, 
and rattlesnakes lurk in bracken sharp enough to razor through trousers. 
Through this landscape, unchanged since the Cherokee were driven from their 
hunting lands a century and a half ago, the agents of the FBI are now stalking 
the thickets in search of Eric Rudolph, America's most wanted fugitive. The 
forest hides other dangers. There are more than a thousand mines within its 
half 
million acres - dangerous, half-hidden workings which date back to the Gold 
Rush. Then there are the natural caves and caverns, some poisoned by 
underground gases so lethal that a single breath renders a victim unconscious 
before their body hits the ground. Lurking among these hazards is Rudolph - 
bombmaker, backwoodsman and expert marksman. A right-wing extremist so 
dangerous the US has ranked him in its cosmology of evil alongside the Islamic 
fundamentalist Osama Bin Laden, who ordered the bombing of the American 
embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, and in which 200 people died.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> In truth, Rudolph - for all the Dollars 1 million price put on his head - is a 
different scale of operator. He has caused minimal disruption when compared 
with his fellow traveller on the lethal fringes of the far right, America's 
most prolific domestic terrorist Timothy McVeigh, who killed 168 and injured 
500 more when he bombed the Federal building in Oklahoma City. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Charged, however, with six counts of bombing and attempted bombing, Rudolph 
committed one particular crime that needs to be read as much for its symbolic 
context as for its body count. The crime that made Rudolph infamous was seen as 
a humiliation for the US in front of the eyes of world. He bombed the 
Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta in 1996, killing one and injuring hundreds, 
including children who were hit by flying nails packed into the crude 
device. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> His next two bombs targeted a clinic -&gt; 
&lt;- which performed abortions, the Sandy Springs Professional Building, north of 
Atlanta, in January 1997. Then Rudolph switched his attention to another group 
loathed by the American far right. He detonated two bombs a month later in the 
Otherside Lounge, a lesbian bar in Atlanta, and injured five people. Rudolph is 
also charged with the 29 January 1998 bombing of another abortion clinic, the 
New Woman All Women Health Care Clinic in Birmingham, Alabama, during which an 
off-duty policeman was killed and a nurse permanently disfigured. Rudolph 
carried each unstable bomb to the site in an army surplus backpack and placed 
it where it should have killed many more. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Eric Rudolph's significance lies not so much in the number of 
people he has killed or maimed but in what he represents. Like McVeigh and the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> Ted Kaczynski (who killed three and injured 23 in a 17-year spate of mail 
bombings), he forms part of the 'leaderless resistance', the lone operators 
that the chief of the FBI's domestic terrorism unit Robert Burnham, describes 
as 'the biggest threat right now' to national security. Burnham embodies a 
contest between all the vast resources of the federal government, against which 
Rudolph and his colleagues on the 'militia' right have pitted themselves. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> This ruthlessness is encapsulated in a single image - the surveillance video 
that unmasked him and began the long manhunt. It comes from the Alabama 
bombing. In the grainy CCTV footage, Rudolph sits patiently in his pick-up 
truck, watching a policemen, Robert Sanderson, bend over to examine the bomb 
just before it 
detonates. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Emily Lyons can remember very little about the morning of 29 January 1998. 
There was little amiss when she arrived early at the New Woman All Women Health 
Centre in Birmingham, Alabama to cover for a fellow nurse on maternity leave. 
She does not recall seeing Rudolph's grey pick-up truck parked outside the 
clinic, or the blast that followed. The shrapnel from the device has left her 
disfigured and has permanently damaged her left eye. Since that morning, a 
series of operations to reconstruct her face have required that she take the 
powerful painkillers Bersed and Fetnayl. These two drugs have impeded her 
memory of events between December 1997 and February 1998. But since the 
bombing, she has learned of witness, forensic, and material evidence amassed by 
the FBI, and its sister organisations involved in the investigation, that has 
convinced her beyond doubt that Rudolph is responsible. 'I feel 
no pity or anger towards him,' she says. 'He didn't know me. He just did it to 
me. I could feel anger if I knew him, but I have no connection with him. I hate 
what he has taken away from me: my job, my socialisation. I fear he'll strike 
again; he has no conscience.' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> What links Rudolph with McVeigh and the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> is a warped version of the backwoods self-sufficiency preached by Henry David 
Thoreau. It is racist, anti-semitic, attached to the rights to bear arms and 
speak one's mind without interference, but rejecting the balancing duties in 
the American constitution of paying taxes and respecting the lives and opinions 
of others. It is Christian fundamentalist and pro-life (anti-abortion) to the 
extent of being prepared to murder doctors and abortion clinic staff. At its 
most bizarre, it believes that the United Nations is trying to take over the 
world. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
Andrews is a tiny one-road town on Interstate Highway 74 on the edge of the 
Nantahala forest, home to 1,699 people, 16 churches and no bars. When an 
Andrews hotel suggested last year that it might want to serve beer to accompany 
food, one of the town's First Baptist ministers wrote a furious letter to the 
local paper suggesting that this was the next step to the hotel declaring 
itself a bordello. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> It was into this deeply God-fearing area in 1981, that the 12-year-old Rudolph 
moved with his family from Florida. They moved into a small house on Partridge 
Creek, in the midst of the Nantahala. His father had just died, and it was a 
new beginning for the family. He enrolled at the local K12 Nantahala High 
School, a tiny cluster of classrooms along a single 
dusty corridor - each year group rarely exceeding 15 in number. Randy Cochran 
was one of Rudolph's better school friends. He and Eric would go camping, play 
war games in the woods and meet girls with the other boys from their area. 'In 
this part of the world, people who live near you are your friends,' he says. 
'It's how life is here.' But Rudolph, who came from outside and whose family 
were not regular church goers, began to feel that he was an outsider - a 
conviction that would deepen with his years in the forest. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> With hindsight it appears these early influences on Rudolph are crucial. For 
Patricia Rudolph, his mother, did little to aid her son's easy assimilation 
into the community that was his new home. Instead, Patricia shared with the 
far-right militia movement a paranoid distrust of the Federal govern ment. She 
refused to give her children's social 
security numbers to the school as she -&gt; 
&lt;- felt it allowed the government to track individuals. Significantly, she also 
introduced her sons to a neighbour, Thomas Wayne Branham, whose bail she paid 
in 1986 when he was charged with federal firearms violations. At his trial, 
Branham had denied the authority of the court and declared himself a 'freeman', 
an opponent of the federal government, before receiving a three-year suspended 
sentence. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Patricia Rudolph had first met Branham when they lived in Florida before they 
moved to Nantahala; the Rudolph children would often stay with him in the 
forest for the summer. When the fatherless family moved to the area, their bond 
was strengthened. The views of Branham and Patricia Rudolph are not unusual in 
the forest. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Two locals tell me about a rumour that has been going around. Someone has seen 
some tanks with United Nations markings, and non-English speaking troops have 
been seen on 
exercises in the forest. A popular theory, they assure me, is that the FBI are 
not solely here to try and catch Rudolph, but that they are acting as a cover 
for a UN takeover of the United States. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> In the deeper recesses of the Nantahala, lives Jay Peircle and her two 
daughters. They have a National Rifle Association bumper sticker on their car 
which declares 'Charlton Heston is my President', two large Confederate flags 
waving in their driveway, and no love for the FBI. Peircle readily tells me 
she'd rather have a beer with Rudolph than the Feds, and wouldn't tell the 
authorities if she found traces of him in the forest. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The first sign of Eric Rudolph's growing disaffection and alienation came at 
16. Rudolph dropped out of school - Randy Cochran says he doesn't know why - 
and stayed at home, in the woods. He returned to education, earning sufficient 
qualifications to enroll in Western Carolina University for two terms, but he 
was becomingly increasingly erratic. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> By the summer of 1986, he had left University to enlist in the army. In August 
1987, he was posted to Fort Benning, Georgia, where he served 18 months before 
being discharged as a private, allegedly after being found smoking cannabis. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Pot-growing is a thriving black economy in Nantahala. Agents working on the 
case have disclosed that Rudolph grew one of the strongest breeds of the drug 
in the hills near his home and sold it on to a dealer in Nash-ville, Tennessee. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> It was after Rudolph returned to Nantahala that the Olympic bombing took 
place, as did the two other Atlanta bombings to which the FBI have now linked 
him. During this time, Rudolph began to betray a few signs that something was 
amiss: he 
started using several pseudonyms - Bob Randolph, Robert Randolph and Bob 
Rudolph - and became ever more reclusive. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The change in Rudolph during this period was noticed by Robin Key, a waitress 
at a local restaurant whom he first met in 1994. Key had been captivated by 
Rudolph's intense eyes, but otherwise says she found him dull and didn't chase 
him up. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> They met again by chance at a video store in 1997. They had dinner soon 
afterwards and went to a barbecue a few weeks later. They watched a few movies 
together and were alone once. Key recalls Rudolph was always good with her 
daughter, Selina, despite the fact that Selina found his quiet demeanour 'a 
little weird'. The last time they met was in an Andrews store in December 1997, 
and Rudolph 'blanked' her. She describes him as 'cold and nonchalant', as if a change had 
come over him. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Two months later, Rudolph was charged with the January 1998 bombing of the 
Birmingham abortion clinic. But by the time the FBI turned up at the trailer he 
was living in, Rudolph had already fled, triggering the biggest man hunt in 
American history. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Jack Thompson, county sheriff at the time, had been asked to look out for 
Rudolph by the FBI and had found him through post office and electricity 
company records at a place called Caney Creek, near Murphy (the next big town 
to Andrews). 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 'My feeling', says the now-retired Thompson, who tipped off the FBI, 'is that 
he turned on the television at 6pm and must have seen news footage that his 
truck had been spotted near the Alabama blast.' Rudolph had been gone no more 
than 30 
minutes, when seven federal agent cars arrived to find his trailer door open, 
the TV blaring and the lights still on. His truck was later dis-covered 
abandoned at St Martin's Creek, near Murphy. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Rudolph's forest trackers go by the name of the Southeast Bomb Task Force - a 
collection of officers from the FBI, the Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms Unit, and 
the Department of Justice. For 30 months they have been scouring the thickets, 
caves and disused mineworkings of the Nantahala forest. The search teams are 
led by trackers from the US Forestry Service and include marksmen and local 
guides. It is tense and exhausting work. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> While Rudolph remains their main quarry, the forest itself has also become an 
enemy, its vastness seeming to collude with the fugitive bomber. Recently, one 
agent had a heart attack while searching its depths. It is little surp(rise 
that 
it took 20 minutes for the search party to hack out a clearing big enough for a 
helicopter to land. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Much of the effort of the search is focused on the forest's caves and mines. 
The caves provide perfect shelter, remaining at a constant temperature during 
the extremes of both summer and winter. Many also contain drinkable spring 
water all year round. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Darren Free has been employed by the SBTF to aid the search over the past 18 
months. A caving expert and accomplished woodsman, he has an extensive 
knowledge of the area's caves which he accumulated while playing in them as a 
child. Free has proven invaluable to the SBTF. A light-hearted man with native 
American roots who makes a living cutting glass in nearby Hendersonville, he 
can theorise for hours about where he thinks 
Rudolph may be -&gt; 
&lt;- hiding. The Dollars 1m reward for his capture has almost lost its appeal for 
Free; for him it is now a personal hunt into which he pours his energy and 
ideas. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Free and the SBTF remain convinced that Rudolph is not only alive but still 
sheltering in the forest. A source close to the search team says they believe 
they have come near to Rudolph on several occasions. Once they heard someone 
talking to themselves in the bushes; they then saw a ponytailed man fleeing the 
scene. Another time, two agents came across a pair of boots on a rock. They 
went for back-up, but on their return they found that the boots were gone. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Rudolph's bootprints are themselves a problem: he has one of the most common 
makes of hiking boot in the country, boots in which legitimate hikers 
trample all over the Nantahala's trails. Regardless of the insurmountable task 
ahead of them, the task force has continued the search. So far it has cost at 
least Dollars 14m. At its peak, the force was 600 strong, now there remains a 
hard core of 12 dedicated hunters who scour the forest at the first sign of a 
fugitive. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The last officially confirmed sighting of someone matching Rudolph's 
description occurred last February, but unofficially there have been sightings 
of a man matching Rudolph's description in the area within the past month, and 
on two of these occasions he was seen with an unidentified female. In February, 
the SBTF found food parcels and boot prints consistent with Rudolph. More 
recently, investigators came across an observation post that Rudolph may have 
been using to survey the area. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> A resident of the remote northern 
Nantahala area has also reported seeing a man matching Rudolph's description at 
regular intervals. A later search of the caves of that region brought to light 
what was described by a source close to the search as 'the strongest lead in 
two years'. In addition, the detailed profiles of Rudolph constructed by the 
FBI and all the evidence collated thus far, point to one conclusion: that 
Rudolph is still in these mountains, because this, if anywhere, is where he 
calls 'home'. More and more, however, the FBI is becoming con vinced that, if 
Rudolph is surviving, it is because there are those out in the forest who are 
helping him. There was a steady pattern of break-ins around the Nantahala area 
in 1998 in which the items stolen - food, supplies and men's boots and shirts - 
were consistent with Rudolph. These break-ins stopped in 1999, suggesting that 
Rudolph had left the area, met his death in the forest, or is receiving 
a regular drop of supplies. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> George Nordmann is the last man that the authorities believe has seen Rudolph 
alive. The taciturn owner of an Andrews health-food store, Nordmann got close 
enough to be able to provide a description of the haggard Rudolph. On 9 July 
1998, Rudolph, then sporting a beard and ponytail, took six months' worth of 
food and supplies and a truck from Nordmann's house. In Nordmann's absence, he 
left Dollars 500 in payment for the items and a note in the truck which 
apologised for the inconvenience. The truck was found abandoned near Nantahala 
and the search picked up pace again. The FBI erected a village of tents on the 
Appletree Campground outside Andrews and helicopters and agents poured into the 
forest. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Today, Nordmann still runs a small health-food store - The Better 
Way - on the main road in Andrews. He has little to say about the events of 
that day, bar confirming that he knew Rudolph's family and Eric himself as a 
child, and that Rudolph went to school with some of Nordmann's 11 children. He 
is tired of the association made between him and Rudolph and yet more fatigued 
by constant calls from reporters. 'There's so much other crime in the world; I 
could wring his neck now, having to put up with this baloney,' he says wearily, 
adding that the Dollars 500 he left 'shows he had some decency. He was not 
robbing me.' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Nordmann's sympathy is political, too. On the wall is a poster picturing two 
little girls in martial arts poses with the advice 'our children are going to 
need more than nursery rhymes to get through the next millennium'. Below is a 
number to call for classes. On one sideboard is an audio 
tape with the conspiratorial label 'The Real United Nations'. If Rudolph is 
still in the forest, he is not without friends.
