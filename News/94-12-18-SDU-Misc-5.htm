<strong>SERIES:</strong> 
<strong>UNABOMBER</strong>

</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong> 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Killing or maiming by bomb is a growth area in the violence industry, one that 
reflects a sharp increase in the number of people willing to 
&quot;go the extra step&quot; to act on a grievance or a grudge, officials say. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The number of bombings usually increases immediately after a high-profile blast 
such as the recent slaying of New Jersey advertising executive Thomas Mosser, 
authorities say.  The killing has been attributed to the so-called 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> believed to be responsible for 15 bombings since 1978. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">And it's not hard to get the materials and know-how to send a bomb.  The basic 
instructions are in books, videos and even on-line.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The information is out there, the people are out there and unfortunately 
something snaps in somebody's mind and they feel that this is the way they need 
to extract their revenge or their intimidation or whatever it might be that 
motivates them to do this crime,&quot; Mike Morrissey, assistant special agent in charge of the San Francisco office 
of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said last week. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Very simply,&quot; said ATF agent Jerry Singer in Chicago, 
&quot;what we have seen is an increase in the intent and the propensity of people 
willing to go the extra step, to put a device together and use it.  It's an 
increase of people with that mind-set. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;It's a cowardly act,&quot; he said, 
&quot;because you don't have to see the consequences right in front of you.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The number of explosives cases jumped 33 percent nationally from 1990 to 1993 
and 55 percent in California, the ATF says.  Officials chalk up part of that 
jump to changes in laws that made such offenses as using illegal fireworks an 
explosives charge, but they say that can't account for all the increase. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Perhaps most ominously, authorities can't pin down any one reason for why more 
people are trying to even the score with a bomb. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Look around the room,&quot; Morrissey said at a news conference last week. 
&quot;Look at how many personalities are here.  There's no discriminating personality 
of a bomber. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;It could be somebody who is mad at her husband, wife, boss.  It could be 
somebody who is a corporate executive, a police officer, anyone of 100,000 
different personalities and people.  It ranges from people who are highly 
educated to people who have no education at all. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;It's like the devices themselves -- each device carries a 
particular signature, and it just ranges with the imagination.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Singer said 37 percent of bombings turn out to be acts of vandalism.  Twenty 
percent are intended as revenge, he said, while smaller percentages are 
protests against something or cold-blooded homicide. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Dr. Bennett Leaventhal, head of psychiatric studies at the University of 
Chicago School of Medicine, said the anti-social behavior that brings about any 
violent crime is seen in bombers. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;There are people at extremes of the spectrum who do not have an illness per se, 
but who solve problems by making enemies and blowing them up,&quot; Leaventhal said.  
&quot;It's possible they have psychiatric disorders, but more probable they do not.  
They have some idiosyncratic feeling about somebody or something and they have 
decided to act on it.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> bombs have been sophisticated.  But only a fundamental knowledge of explosives 
is 
needed to make a crude, lethal bomb, Singer said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In fact, materials and assembly instructions have been available for years, 
published in books with such titles as 
&quot;The Poor Man's James Bond,&quot; 
&quot;Explosives Grandma Used to Make&quot; and 
&quot;Deadly Brew,&quot; said Jerry Taylor, ATF explosives enforcement officer in San Francisco. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Even videos are available, and instructions have been known to show up on 
computer bulletin boards, said Susan McCarron, an ATF spokeswoman in 
Washington, D.C. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;These are groups we are not real fond of,&quot; she said, 
&quot;but there is not a whole lot we can do about it until somebody actually makes a 
bomb or a threat. There's nothing in the explosives law we can do about these 
things.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Copycat bombings or threats are common after a major bombing, said ATF Agent-in-Charge Bernard LaForest of the Arizona office in Phoenix.  So are false reports 
of bombs.  In San Francisco, police Capt. Lawrence Minasian said that since the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> struck last Saturday, the department has received four or five calls a day 
about suspicious packages.  Normally, he said, the department handles two or 
three such calls a week. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;People are paranoid,&quot; Minasian said.
