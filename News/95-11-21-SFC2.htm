</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
 A MAN WITH 20/20 MORAL VISION 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Editor -- This letter is to draw attention to the article (May 13) on Rafael 
Sencion's willing relinquishment of his job for his more needy co-worker, Larry 
Wood. When budget cuts threatened the New York City SRO Law Project, where the 
men worked to help poor people avert eviction, Wood, who had less seniority 
than Sencion by two months, was slated for termination, while Sencion's job was 
to be retained. But Sencion, a bachelor from the Dominican Republic, intervened 
because Wood's wife was pregnant. He told his friend, ''You can't afford to 
lose your job.'' He resigned instead, allowing his co-worker to remain 
employed.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In these times, when social programs await imminent destruction, when whites 
fear that their jobs are being taken by minorities, when the commitment to 
helping those in need is failing, people ask ''Why should I sacrifice my tax 
dollar to help the poor?'' and ''Why should I step aside for an equally 
qualified minority?'' Sencion's actions show the moral bankruptcy of this 
political climate, But his story at the same time is a torch of light in the 
gloom. Sencion, a member of a ''minority'' community, worked eight years to 
help poor people stay housed and then sacrificed his own livelihood to help a 
fellow worker. Unlike the ruling stereotypes of social workers, he had no 
bureaucratic or selfish attachment to his job and never lost sight of the ''big 
picture.'' And unlike the stereotypes of minorities as ''special interest 
groups,'' Sencion's concern for those who needed 
help crossed race and class boundaries.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Now that he is unemployed, what is he doing? Living on his severance and 
working with his own community to support striking Dominican grocery workers. 
And despite the political climate of this country right now, Sencion is not 
interested in taking the moral high ground.  When queried by the press about 
his actions, he responded, ''There are lots of good people out there who under 
the same circumstances would have done the same thing. I'm sure of it.'' I 
would like to believe him. This man's clear moral vision makes him a hero in 
these troubled times.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">IGNORANCE ISN'T MALICE
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Editor -- I was only ten years old when my grandmother and I used to ply the 
public course at Lake Worth, Fla. She drove the ball; I drove the cart. Though 
it was 35 years ago, I 
remember clear as a bell her explaining to me how she had some difficulty 
hitting the long shots because her ''boosoms'' got in the way.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">I don't know the facts or the tone of Ben Wright's apparent remarks about women 
and golf, but my hackles go up when I see editorial writers gleefully skewering 
the CBS sports commentator.  It's always easy to pile on when someone does 
something stupid.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Inevitably, the editorialists link Wright's remarks about lesbians tainting the 
image of golf and women being handicapped with ''boobs'' to the self-dethroning 
remarks made by former sports commentator Jimmy the Greek and Dodgers executive 
Al Campanis.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">I write not to defend ignorance, but to recognize it for what it is -- a lack 
of knowledge, or perhaps in all three of these cases, the belief in incorrect 
information. Because it does 
seem that these men said what they did, not out of rancor, but believing that 
what they were saying was true. That's different from taking malicious shots at 
people. Very different.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">If the high and mighty in the media and professional sports who are so ready to 
lynch were more concerned with eradicating discrimination than in looking for 
the nearest tree and a rope, they would consider re-educating these errants and 
sending them on the road to share what they have learned.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">OSTLER'S ERROR
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Editor -- Scott Ostler (Sunday, May 7) fell into a prevalent error when he 
referred to Caryl Chessman (the ''Red-Light Bandit'') as a murderer.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Chessman, a career criminal, was not charged with murder. His death penalty was 
imposed for a technical conviction of kidnapping, on the finding that he took 
his victim a short distance from her car before raping her. He was not found 
guilty of the series of 
crimes blamed on the ''Red-Light Bandit.''

</p><p class="body" align="Left">OPEN-MINDED
</p><p class="body" align="Left">EDitor -- That was a great article about the Susanville coach Ed Murin (''The 
Price of Tenure,'' Sunday, May 7) by Nanette Asimov. I love it that the man 
mentions that his wife is Italian, to help show he's not prejudiced. I'm 
surprised such an open-minded person hasn't moved to San Francisco by now.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">TELL BOTH SIDES
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Editor -- Nanette Asimov's missive on tenure was not a fair look at the issue. 
As a science teacher, I am fully aware that one case does not prove the rule. 
She could have focused equally as well on a teacher who was unfairly dismissed 
for arbitrary or political reasons to ''prove'' that teachers are not 
adequately protected. That is 
not to say that the system of teacher retention (it is not tenure) cannot be 
improved. However, this article is without in-depth research and does not even 
provide case histories from both sides of the story.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Ironically, the right-wing effort to deny teachers due process may very well 
backfire. In many districts, the central office administrators put 
extraordinary pressure on schools to cut down on the amount of flunking. In 
many schools the only thing standing in the way of a complete abandonment of 
standards is the protection of teachers from unwarranted firing.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A VOICE FROM THE LEFT
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Editor -- Steve McLin wrote (Letters to the Editor, May 7) about how folks on 
the left side of the political spectrum were quick to condemn Limbaugh, et al, 
for the vitriol that inspired the bombing in Oklahoma 
City, while remaining in ''deafening'' silence regarding the 
<strong>Unabomber.</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">OK, I'll take the bait.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">I consider myself on the liberal-to-radical side. Mr. McLin, please note: The 
deeds of the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> are despicable and repulsive.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He does not represent me or any left-leaner I know. The only people represented 
by the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> are wackos like himself.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He belongs in a cell, preferably one right next to the rightest militia 
bombers. They'd probably find they have a lot in common.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">QUIET TOO LONG
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Editor -- It is with sadness that I reflect on President Bush's repudiation of 
the National Rifle Association. One wonders how many lives could have been 
saved had Bush and others in high position had the courage to speak out against 
this juvenile fascination with weapons that serves no purpose except to kill 
a daughter, son, mother, father or neighbor. Perhaps he can now join the good 
company of Robert McNamara in proposing a new amendment: ''Thou shall not 
kill,'' and some tough anti-weapon legislation to make it a lot harder to 
disobey the moral imperative.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">GRATEFUL TO BUSH
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Editor -- I am profoundly grateful to George Bush for his public NRA 
resignation.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">I think many of us are fearful for our country when all we seem to hear is 
violent rhetoric, and all we seem to see is violent action.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">What we as a nation need is a return to civil discourse and civil behavior. 
President Bush helped that concept along in a very powerful and moving way, and 
I only hope other prominent leaders will do the same.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">FIRST 
PERSON
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Editor -- I really enjoy your Sunday ''First Person,'' so often about a woman's 
personal experience. It's like talking to a friend -- I love it. Wish they made 
movies like this.
