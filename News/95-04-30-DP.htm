</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong> 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">He says he bombs his victims to promote 
&quot;anti-industrial ideas&quot; and to stave off 
&quot;environmental degradation through excessive economic growth.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">He cites 
&quot;radical environmentalist journals,&quot; and he clearly has an odd fascination with wood. One of his bombs was impacted 
with twigs, the last name of one victim was Wood and last week, in his latest 
attack, he killed a lobbyist for the timber industry. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The message seems clear: the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> after 17 years and 23 bombings, has decided to declare himself an 
environmentalist. And he did it in letters mailed one day after the Oklahoma 
City bombing, yet another act of terror apparently fueled by political 
extremism.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Environmentalists, however, are calling the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> something else: a fraud. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;All of a sudden the guy is sprouting green leaves,&quot; said Gar Smith, editor of the San Francisco-based Earth Island Journal, who 
has spent hours studying the rambling letters the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> sent last week to The New York Times and one of his victims. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Of the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> writings, Smith said, 
&quot;They don't sound like anything I have ever seen in any environmental journal. 
Rather, it sounds to me like he is trying to coin words that he expects would 
appear in radical environmental journals. His terminology is just all wrong.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">There is no mention of 
&quot;deep ecology, 
&quot;eco-centrism,&quot; 
&quot;bio-centrism,&quot; the abolition of 
&quot;nation states&quot; or other catchwords running through the most radical strains of the 
environmental movement. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">There is only the odd jargon of a man whose methods are not only abhorrent his 
mail 
bombs have killed three people and injured 22 but absolutely contrary to all 
that the environmental movement stands for, say the overwhelming majority of 
advocates. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Fundamentally, the environmental movement is one that embraces the sanctity of 
life, beginning with human life,&quot; said Robert Kennedy of the Pace Environmental Litigation Clinic. 
&quot;It does not destroy life.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">At the extreme edge of the environmental movement is Earthfirst!, a loose-knit 
group of environmentalists known for 
&quot;spiking&quot; redwoods in the Pacific Northwest. The practice, which involves driving large 
ceramic nails into trees, has the effect of destroying saws that try to cut 
them down. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The group's motto 
&quot;No compromise in defense of Mother Earth!&quot; seems to leave open the question of violence. But Earthfirst! has never been 
tied to any act that seriously injured another person, said Bron Taylor, an 
associate professor of environmental 
ethics at the University of Wisconsin who is writing a book on the group. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Last week, Earthfirst! members vehemently criticized the 
<strong>Unabomber.</strong> 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The basic principle behind our movement is protecting all life, be it that of a 
human or an endangered animal,&quot; said Earthfirst! member Leslie Hemstreet. 
&quot;We would never condone bombing anyone.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">There are other reasons to believe the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> is a loner, despite his assertion that members of his group are 
&quot;widespread and growing.&quot; The federal government since 1993 has offered a reward of $ 1 million for his 
capture, a sum that might be hard for his associates to resist, if indeed there 
are any. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;We are convinced it is one person,&quot; said FBI spokesman Rick Smith. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Many environmentalists also believe that if a rogue group of bomb-making 
eco-terrorists did try to organize, word would spread quickly through the vast, 
often interconnected world of 
environmental advocacy. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">As for the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> self-described opposition to the 
&quot;industrial system,&quot; his comments there also seem to fall flat with scholars who study the effects 
of industry and technology on society. It's a topic that professors can spend 
hours debating, but it's not something that has ever spawned a violent 
backlash, at least in this country. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Respectable figures have always had deep questions about the ultimate impact of 
an industrial economy, but the difference here is the lengths to which [the 
<strong>Unabomber]</strong> is willing to go,&quot; said Bruce Seely, head of the Society for the History of Technology, an 
academic organization. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I don't think most believe that if someone disagrees with you, you shoot them 
or blow them up with a bomb,&quot; he said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">More likely, said criminologists, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> is an attention-starved psychotic whose motivations have far more to do with 
generating headlines than any coherent world view. 
Many believe it is significant that he mailed his last bomb one day after the 
Oklahoma bombing.
