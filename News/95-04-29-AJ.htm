Crime? What crime? 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Atlanta City Councilwoman Carolyn Long Banks was criticized for publicly 
stating before Freaknik weekend that she had been told of a police plan to kill 
some of the college students taking part in the event. Now Banks has responded 
to the critics: By saying what was in the works, she foiled the plot and saved 
lives, she said in a press conference Thursday. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Well. After recovering from the breathtaking logic of that statement, anyone 
can see the valuable role Banks can play in Atlanta.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Banks can say she has learned of a plan by animal rights activists to sneak 
into the zoo and free Willie B. from the gorilla compound. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">When Atlanta hosts the Super Bowl again, she can announce a plot by crazed 
flight attendants to hijack a 747 on a runway at Hartsfield International 
Airport and taxi all the way to the Georgia Dome, where 70,000 football fans 
will be forced to eat tiny bags of peanuts. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">And right before the 1996 Olympic Games, Banks can reveal a radical group's 
intent to sabotage synchronized swimming by playing heavy metal music during 
the competition. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">When none of these events takes place, Banks can take credit for more crimes 
prevented. And Atlanta will be a safer place. 


The mask slips 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> that selective and maddeningly elusive terrorist-by- mail, turns out to be a latter-day Luddite. Luddites were English workmen 
who violently opposed labor-saving devices in the early 19th century and did 
their darnedest to stop the Industrial Revolution dead in its tracks. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">With this week's communications to the FBI, The New York Times and one of his 
early victims, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> has revealed himself as a contemptuous and deadly enemy of technological 
change. He also seems a bit nearer the edge psychologically than when he began 
his 17-year terror campaign. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Until this week, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> had given his FBI pursuers precious little to go on. Suddenly, however, he 
seems ready to unburden himself, offering to stop sending his lethal missives 
if some reputable publication will print his 41,000-word screed on the world as 
he sees it. With that slightly loony offer, of course, is the implied threat he 
will keep bombing, and maybe even 
up the ante, if he is refused. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">This week's revelations have given the FBI plenty to chew on, and it is 
undertaking one of the most exhaustive computer analyses and searches in law 
enforcement history to find him. For the digitalized detectives to finally run 
him to ground would be justice, poetic and otherwise. 


Tough guy 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">State Rep. Billy McKinney of Atlanta is building himself quite a record. 
Unfortunately, it is the record of a thug, not a legislator. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Two years ago, an advocate for gay-rights issues alleged that McKinney struck 
her during a physical confrontation in Atlanta City Hall. McKinney denied the 
charge. 
&quot;I didn't hit her,&quot; he said. 
&quot;I'd like to hit her, but I didn't.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Last year, McKinney was charged with threatening a federal witness, U.S. Rep. 
Gary Franks of Connecticut, who was testifying 
in a court hearing involving the congressional district of McKinney's daughter, 
U.S. Rep. Cynthia McKinney. Among other things, McKinney challenged Franks to 
&quot;fight like a man.&quot; The confrontation was captured on video, and McKinney, after apologizing, was 
hit with a $ 500 fine. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">This year, McKinney got into a yelling match with a fellow state legislator in 
which, according to witnesses, McKinney again threatened physical violence, 
and, by some accounts, even brandished a pocketknife. 
&quot;I don't carry a knife,&quot; McKinney now says. 
&quot;I carry a gun.&quot; 


What a charming fellow.
