</p><p class="body" align="Left">Federal authorities Wednesday offered a $ 1 million reward for information 
that helps catch the elusive 
&quot;<strong>unabomber&quot;</strong> who has killed one person and injured 23 others since 1978.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;We do not have any viable suspects at this time and we need the public's help,&quot; said George Clow, who heads an FBI task force of 45.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
&quot;<strong>unabomber&quot;</strong> - so named because two of his targets are universities and airlines - has been 
linked to 14 bombings since 1978.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Clow said a psychological profile indicates that the bomber, who last struck 
this summer, will attack again.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Investigators Wednesday said they believe a mysterious note with the 
inscription 
&quot;Call Nathan R Wed 7 PM&quot; could have been written by the bomber to himself.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Investigators did not say where or how the note was found. Authorities hope 
&quot;Nathan&quot; or someone who knows him will come forward.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bomber is believed to have made the call to 
&quot;Nathan&quot; in June, the same month two mail bombs exploded in California and Connecticut.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bomber's targets have included university professors and others associated 
with the airline and computer industries. But no clear motive has emerged.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The most recent bombs were mailed June 18 from Sacramento to professors.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">On June 22, Charles Epstein, a geneticist at the University of California at 
San Francisco lost 
several fingers when a mail bomb exploded at his home in Tiburon, Calif. Two 
days later, Yale computer scientist David Gelernter was gravely injured when a 
letter or package exploded as he opened it in his office.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The sole death linked to the bomber occurred in December 1985 when Hugh 
Scrutton, 38, picked up a bomb at his computer store.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">On June 21, a letter claiming a group was responsible for bombs was mailed from 
Sacramento to The New York Times. Investigators are treating the letter as 
authentic; it bore the same initials - 
&quot;FC&quot; that have been found on some of the bombs.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bomber is 
&quot;acting out something,&quot; said Clow. An FBI profile suggests the bomber is:
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A white male, single or divorced, in his late 40s or early 50s.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Neat and meticulous - someone 
who may appear to be a 
&quot;nice guy&quot; except for a macabre sense of humor.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The government has contributed $ 450,000 of the reward money; $ 550,000 was 
pledged by unidentified private donors. A federal toll-free number for tips: 
1-800-701-BOMB. All information will be confidential.
