</p><p class="body" align="Left">Federal investigators, acknowledging that they have no viable suspects in a 
series of university faculty bombings, revealed a new clue Wednesday and 
offered a $ 1 million reward for information to catch and convict those 
responsible.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The clue is a telephone call reminder believed to have been written by the 
bomber around the time of the latest mail bombings in June, after a six-year 
lapse: 
&quot;Call Nathan R wed 7 pm.&quot; FBI Director <a href="http://www.unabombers.com/z19.htm">Louis Freeh</a> said 
&quot;Nathan R&quot; may be innocently associated with the culprit and urged him or others with 
knowledge to relay their information to a special toll-free number 
(1-800-701-BOMB).  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Freeh appeared with Ronald Noble, assistant Treasury secretary for 
enforcement, and the heads of the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Bureau and the 
chief postal inspector. They formed a task force with the FBI in June to crack 
the 14 bombings, which have killed one person and injured 23 since 1978.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> George Clow, the FBI inspector who heads the 
<strong>Unabom</strong> task force - so named because incidents have occurred at universities and on 
an airliner - declined to explain how the note was unearthed on the ground that 
doing so could interfere with the investigation. But other sources indicated 
that the telephone reminder was somehow linked to a letter sent to the New York 
Times in June discussing the bombings.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> It included the initials 
&quot;FC,&quot; which also have been engraved in the bombs that have survived the blasts. The 
letter was postmarked after the packages containing the bombs were sent but 
before they exploded.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The 
letter described 
&quot;an anarchist group calling ourselves FC&quot; and promised 
&quot;information about our goals at some future time.&quot; Clow said that information has not been forthcoming, leading investigators to 
fear that the bomber will strike again. They are particularly concerned about 
November. The bomber has occasionally sent packages around the anniversary 
dates of earlier bombings, and he has struck twice on Nov. 15.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Noble, on leave from the New York University School of Law, described 
&quot;the apprehension faculty members and students throughout our country feel about 
the random bombs that have struck campuses in California, Michigan, Tennessee, 
Illinois and Connecticut.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> While declining to discuss other leads investigators are pursuing, Clow 
released a psychological profile of the bomber drawn up by ATF and FBI experts. 
 It describes the culprit as a white male loner in his 
late 40s or early 50s, probably an obsessive-compulsive who has difficulties 
forming personal relationships and is neat and rigid, with a macabre sense of 
humor. He may appear to be a 
&quot;nice guy&quot; and not apparently predisposed to violence.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The mail bombs in June that severely injured Charles Epstein, a University of 
California, San Francisco, geneticist, and David Gelernter, a Yale University 
computer scientist, bore Sacramento return addresses, as did the letter sent to 
the Times. But the task force, which operates out of San Francisco and 
Sacramento, said there was no firm indication that the bomber lived in 
California.
