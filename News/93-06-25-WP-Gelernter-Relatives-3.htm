A mail bomb exploded yesterday in the hands of a world-renowned Yale computer 
scientist in what federal officials said was the second blast this week that 
could be linked to a serial bomber in operation since 1978.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The choice of targets in the Yale case and the Tuesday bombing of a geneticist 
at the University of California at San Francisco bears the hallmark of the 
elusive 
&quot;<strong>UNABOM,</strong>&quot; who targeted employees of the computer industry and university researchers for 
more than a decade before stopping the bombings in 1987, officials said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) has added the Tuesday bombing 
in California that injured Charles Epstein to its 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> incident list, and FBI agents in New Haven, Conn., said there was an 
&quot;unavoidable question of connection&quot; to yesterday morning's bombing of David Gelernter at Yale University.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Named for a penchant for targeting academics, 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> is believed to be responsible for 12 bombings from 1978 to 1987 in seven 
states that killed one person and injured 21. Despite the creation of a 
federal-state 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> Task Force, which is still active, the bomber's whereabouts and motives remain 
a mystery, officials said. What is known is the similarity of the victims, all 
of whom were either university scientists or employees in the computer and 
airline industries.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Gelernter, who created a language allowing desktop computers to achieve the 
power of supercomputers, triggered the explosion when he opened a package 
around 8:15 a.m. at the school's computer center. As the building's sprinkler 
system doused a small blaze, Gelernter, 38, raced down five flights of stairs 
and across the street to the student infirmary, leaving a trail of blood and 
fending off bystanders with cries of 
&quot;Leave me alone!&quot; He was listed in stable condition following surgery to repair severe wounds to 
his abdomen, chest, face and hands.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Across the country two days earlier, Epstein opened a package in the kitchen of 
his home in Tiburon, Calif., that had arrived in mail brought in by his 
daughter Joanna, according to Rick Smith, spokesman for the FBI's San Francisco 
bureau. The explosion blew off several of 
Epstein's fingers, broke his arm and caused several abdominal injuries. 
Epstein, 59, known for his work locating a gene that may contribute to Down's 
syndrome, was listed in fair condition following surgery.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>UNABOM</strong> has never shied from targeting well-known people. One early victim was Percy 
Wood, the president of United Airlines who was targeted in June 1980, according 
to the ATF. Among the 14 listed 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> incidents, at least six bombs were mailed and eight were put in place by the 
suspect. Federal officials said the San Francisco package carried 
<strong>UNABOM's</strong> signature: a pipe bomb nestled in a small package, its explosion triggered by 
touch.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">FBI Director William S. Sessions warned university officials yesterday 
&quot;to be alert to all packages and mail received&quot; at their 
offices and homes. In addition to this week's suspected 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> incidents, 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> explosive devices have been found in the past at Northwestern University, 
Vanderbilt University and the University of Michigan.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Also targeted were Boeing Aircraft Co., Rentech Computer Rental and United 
Airlines. One mail bomb detonated on American Airlines Flight 444 on Nov. 15, 
1979, bound for Washington, D.C., from Chicago. Twelve people suffered smoke 
inhalation when the bomb exploded during the flight.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> suspect disappeared and apparently discontinued his bombings following a Feb. 
20, 1987, blast in Salt Lake City in which a witness was able to offer a 
general description of a man who left a package that exploded in a parking lot, 
injuring an employee of CAAMS Inc., a computer sales and 
service company. The white male was described as slender, 5-foot-10 to 6 feet 
tall and 25 to 30 years old with reddish-blond hair.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">ATF officials believe the Salt Lake City sighting may have forced him 
underground. They said they had little knowledge of 
<strong>UNABOM's</strong> whereabouts or activities since 1987 and did not know why he would choose to 
strike again now.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">FBI spokesman Smith said in San Francisco that the 
&quot;manner of construction and the [Epstein] bomb's unique signature appears to be 
related forensically to 
<strong>UNABOM.</strong> We are looking at 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> more than anyone else.&quot; A return address on the San Francisco package was that of another university 
official who told investigators he had not mailed it, a federal official said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">At a news conference in San Francisco, Sessions said the FBI is pursuing links 
between the two 
cases and 
<strong>UNABOM.</strong> 
&quot;The FBI will go back and look at all the bombings of a similar character. It's 
the logical thing to be done, and it will be done,&quot; he said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Eugene Sorets, a postdoctoral student in Yale's computer science department, 
was in his second-floor office yesterday morning when he heard a sound like 
&quot;someone dropped a heavy metal object.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Soon I heard groaning,&quot; said Sorets, 
&quot;and I looked out my window and saw Gelernter running across the street. After 
the fire alarm went off, I saw blood on the stairs and his bloody shirt lying 
on the stairway.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Federal, state and local law enforcement officials said yesterday afternoon 
that they had not yet found enough evidence to link the Yale bomb to the one in 
San Francisco. Still, 
one FBI official said the suspicion was 
&quot;unavoidable.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;A mail bomb in the same 48 hours -- both to academics, both scientific 
researchers?&quot; asked John Sennett, spokesman for the New Haven branch of the FBI. 
&quot;The question of a possible link is most certainly there.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Following radio reports of yesterday's bombing, Gelernter's brother Joel, a 
Yale geneticist, was told 
&quot;You are next&quot; by a caller to the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, according to federal 
officials.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Sheryll Gelernter, a relative of David Gelernter, also is a postdoctoral fellow 
in genetic epidemiology. And a colleague of David Gelernter, Vladimir Rokhlin, 
said he had created computer programs currently used by the Human Genome 
Project, the multimillion-dollar effort to map the genes of the human body.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;He is a very benign, blandish fellow,&quot; Rokhlin said. 
&quot;Everyone is worried and irritated. 
I know I certainly am not going to open packages in the future without being 
really cautious.&quot;

Francisco contributed to this report.
