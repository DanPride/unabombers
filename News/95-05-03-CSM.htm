</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">THE arrest May 3 of two witnesses in the 
Oklahoma City bombing underscores both the triumphs and trials of what may be 
America's largest-ever manhunt.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In FBI offices in Oklahoma, Kansas, Arizona, and Michigan, agents have been 
working grueling hours since the bombing. From the command post at the Myriad 
Convention Center here, lawPenforcement officials have been choreographing 
federal, state, and local agents in an elaborate nationwide crime-chasing dance 
that is, at once, both sophisticated and simple.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">As some agents sift through the dust of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building 
looking for fragments of the fertilizer bomb or Ryder truck it was carried in, 
other agents are banging on doors from Oklahoma to Arizona, carrying sketches 
of ''John Doe No. 2'' to every gasPstation attendant and hotel clerk.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Police divers plumb the depths of a Kansas swamp looking for explosives 
paraphernalia, while other agents, in sterile labs across the country, test 
fertilizer for ''fingerprints.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The two witnesses detained yesterday, Gary Allen Land and Robert Jacks, were 
picked up at a motel in Carthage, Mo., 200 miles northeast of Oklahoma City. 
Mr. Land is reportedly a friend of bombing suspect Timothy McVeigh and 
resembles John Doe No. 2. Land and Mr. Jacks 
stayed for five months at a motel in Kingman, Ariz., a town frequented by Mr. 
McVeigh.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Of the tens of thousands of leads the FBI has received, many have been helpful. 
Far more haven't. On one occasion, FBI officers responded to a tip about John 
Doe No. 2 and wound up surrounding a Kansas motorist with a helicopter and a 
phalanx of police cars only to determine, after two hours of questioning, that 
he was just a motorist.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Some FBI officials contend privately that flagrant media reports about breaks 
in the case both complicate the investigation, and fuel unreasonable public 
expectations. For instance, while press reports said three witnesses had 
identified bombing suspect McVeigh in a lineup, FBI investigators testified 
before a federal 
magistrate that none of them, in fact, had been able to immediately identify 
McVeigh as the tattooed, crew-cut man they saw in a Ryder truck moments before 
the bombing.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Like everything else connected with the Oklahoma case, federal lawPenforcement 
authorities are being closely scrutinized for their conduct. Certainly they 
have improved their image since the days of the Branch Davidian raid two years 
ago. Everyone from President Clinton on down has lauded agents for moving with 
dispatch and discipline.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Yet, as if a reminder of how difficult such cases can be, a serial killer known 
as the ''<strong>Unabomber'</strong>' -- who has claims to have eluded authorities for 17 years -- recently sent a 
letter to a major newspaper, ridiculing the FBI as ''a joke.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Indeed, the biggest battle investigators may face is a public used to TV cop 
shows. ''People have been spoiled,'' 
says Harvey Burstein, a former FBI agent who now teaches a criminology course 
at Northeastern University in Boston. ''They seem to think that investigations 
can be wrapped up in 60 minutes with time for commercial breaks.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI is building a case one lead at a time. If someone calls the tip line 
and it sounds rational, Mr. Burstein says, ''the FBI is bound to check up on 
that lead, even if it goes nowhere.'' Above all, he says, investigators have to 
block out the public and remain detached.
