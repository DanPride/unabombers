</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>

<p class="body" align="Left">WASHINGTON - Navy investigators routinely send informants and undercover agents 
into Washington-area gay bars to identify military personnel among the clients, 
then use sting operations to catch some of them in drug trafficking, according 
to Navy officials and testimony in a recent military court proceeding.
Local and national gay advocates contend that the probe circumvents the 
Pentagon's 
&quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; policy and might be a way of drumming gays out of the military, albeit for 
drugs. The Navy contends the year-old operation never has been used to enforce 
the continuing ban on homosexual activity by service members.
The Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) 
&quot;does not target individuals based on their sexual orientation,&quot; director David Brant said in a June 8 letter responding to complaints from the 
Servicemembers Legal Defense 
Network, a group that assists gays.  

The undercover operation involves surveillance at three establishments that 
cater primarily to gay men, NCIS agent John Patrick O'Connor Jr. testified in 
the case of a Navy petty officer facing a court martial for drug dealing.
Under questioning by a defense attorney, O'Connor could not cite heterosexual 
establishments targeted by NCIS surveillance.
Brant said in his letter that the undercover operation involves a variety of 
night spots, 
&quot;including several that are not considered to be gay establishments.&quot;


N.Y. police use racial profiling, civil-rights commission says

WASHINGTON - The New York Police Department improperly uses racial profiling to 
stop and question people, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights concluded 
yesterday.
This police tactic is a factor in the racial tensions that can lead to 
&quot;tragic and unnecessary&quot; incidents such as the shooting of Amadou Diallo, according to a report 
approved 6-2 by the advisory panel.
The report also calls into question department training and recruitment of 
black and Hispanic officers. It recommends creation of an independent office to 
investigate accusations that police wrongly used deadly force.
Diallo was shot and killed outside his Bronx home Feb. 4, 1999, struck 19 times 
in a hail of 41 shots from police officers. Four officers were acquitted.
