<strong>Unabomber</strong> sends taunting letter to computer expert hurt previously

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Federal officials Wednesday released the text of a letter in which the 
mysterious serial bomber in the Unabom case ridicules one of his victims for 
opening the package that exploded and maimed him.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The letter was sent to David Gelernter, a prominent Yale University computer 
science professor who was injured in June 1993.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
&quot;People with advanced degrees aren't as smart as they think they are,&quot; the writer taunted. 
&quot;If you'd had any brains you would have realized that there are a lot of people 
out there who resent bitterly the way techno-nerds like you are changing the 
world and you wouldn't have been dumb enough to open an unexpected package from 
an unknown source.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The three-paragraph letter, postmarked Oakland, Calif., April 20, went on to 
criticize Gelernter's 1991 book, 
&quot;Mirror Worlds.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
&quot;In the epilogue of your book,&quot; the letter said, 
&quot;you tried to justify your research by claiming that the developments you 
describe are inevitable, and that any college person can learn enough about 
computers to compete in a computer-dominated world. Apparently people without a 
college degree don't count.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Law-enforcement officials long have believed that the bomber was violently 
opposed to changes in society brought about by computer technology. But until 
now, their intuition about motives were based almost wholly on circumstantial 
evidence.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The FBI said Wednesday that in addition to letters received this week by the 
New York Times and Gelernter, two other letters had been sent, but it 
refused to reveal their recipients or contents.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The FBI said all four letters were mailed April 20 from the Oakland, Calif., 
area.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> By sending the letters, the bomber sharply increases the odds that he will be 
captured, investigators said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> A San Francisco-based task force investigating the bomber is taking advantage 
of new technology that includes testing for DNA in any saliva traces on 
envelopes or stamps.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Along with the compulsion to explain himself, there were indications in 
Monday's bombing that the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> has become sloppier.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The bomb that killed California Forestry Association President Gilbert Murray 
was addressed to William Dennison, who left the job a year ago. Also, the 
package was addressed to an old name for the group, the Timber Association of 
California.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> It was the second Unabom fatality in five months and the third since the 
bombings began in 1978. 
Twenty-two other people have been wounded.
