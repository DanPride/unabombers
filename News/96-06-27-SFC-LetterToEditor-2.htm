</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">REASONABLE DOUBT AND THE 
<strong>UNABOMBER</strong> TRIAL
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Editor -- As a recent Chronicle article (''Arguments for Reasonable Doubt,'' 
June 19) suggests, the pending 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> trial will provide a welcome, though disturbing, glimpse at the troubled 
tenets of reasonable doubt. When first conceived in common law, the 
prosecutorial burden of ''guilt beyond a reasonable doubt'' meant just that -- 
beyond a reasonable doubt. Tragically, recent interpretations have rendered 
this burden of proof subject to absurd and unreasonable possibilities.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">While Ted Kaczynski's foray into the world of bomb making and his ostensible 
manifesto attesting to the use of these bombs is not condemning proof, it is 
wholly persuasive and highly suggestive. Jurors should not be asked to exclude 
skills of common sense when in a court of law. If anything, such skills should 
be heightened and emphasized.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Although it is doubtful that any reliable 
<strong>witnesses</strong> will be produced to attest to Kaczynski's actual placement of the explosives 
and no videotape will be offered showing the crime in progress, jurors should 
not be held hostage to modern manipulations of the law. I fear that the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> trial may provide more testament to the shattered status of the doctrines of 
reasonable doubt and symbolize the ultimate subjugation of common sense.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">GET EVEN WITH THE JUDGES
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Editor -- I was absolutely appalled when I first heard that the state Supreme 
Court decided to allow judges more discretion when imposing the 
''three-strikes'' law. But after giving it some thought I've reconsidered. If 
our society is really interested in making and keeping our streets safe, we 
need to 
<strong>identify</strong> and expose those judges who insist on handing down light sentences which allow 
these 
criminals the freedom of turning our streets into their own personal war zones.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The next step is to hold these judges personally responsible for the crimes 
committed by those criminals who are the recipients of their lenient sentences.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">IT'S ABOUT CONTROL
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Editor -- Regarding Jody Smith's letter (Chronicle, June 19): Smith arrogantly 
claims to understand all women; ''I clearly believe that women feel they are 
expected to abort unplanned pregnancies.'' It's the woman's right to decide if 
and when she will give birth, this decison being based upon her private moral 
and spiritual beliefs.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Most opposition to abortion comes from men. They condemn late-term abortions of 
severely deformed fetuses that threaten the mother's life. Even birth control 
which prevents conception is opposed by male-dominated religions such as 
Catholicism and fundamentalist sects.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The issue is not the welfare of fetuses. It is 
male control of women. Men interpret the Bible and twist Scripture to forbid 
birth control and abortion in order to ensure a steady supply of consumers and 
soldiers to enrich the corporate elite. Thus, religion is used to intimidate 
women into having children.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">If the so-called ''pro-lifers'' weren't hypocrites, they would support birth 
control to prevent conception. They could thus end abortion without murdering 
doctors and bombing women's clinics.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">SCAPEGOATING
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Editor -- I was disgusted to read that during his recent visit to California, 
presidential candidate Bob Dole said that public schools would have more 
teachers and computers if we refused to school undocumented immigrant children. 
Here we have someone who wants to deny education to immigrant kids for economic 
reasons yet wants to bring back the ''Star Wars'' missile defense system that 
no self-respecting scientist believes will ever 
work and that will cost tens of billions of dollars.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">I ask: how many more teachers and computers could we afford with that budget?
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Dole also supports the ''three strikes, you're out'' law, that costs taxpayers 
$ 20,000 a year per convict for 25 years, and has been used to convict people 
whose third strike was to steal a pizza.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The reason we don't have more teachers and computers (not to mention better 
funded schools and up-to-date textbooks) is not the fault of poor immigrants. 
How we spend our tax money is a question of priorities.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Do we want smart kids or smart bombs? Do we want more schools or more jails? We 
shouldn't scapegoat and blame the poor for problems created by our so-called 
political ''leaders.''

</p><p class="body" align="Left">FEINSTEIN'S YING AND YANG
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Editor -- It's a strange feeling indeed to pick 
up the morning paper and read that a politician one has long respected and 
supported has done something very good and something very bad on the very same 
day.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Senator Dianne Feinstein's campaign finance bill is brilliant and long overdue. 
But that's not why I am writing. Her support of efforts to exclude legal aliens 
from Medi-Cal is as short-sighted as her expressed reason for doing so. As a 
U.S. senator, she must know that far more than 70 percent of the green-card 
residents in her own state have worked hard, never collected a penny of public 
assistance, and paid billions into the state and federal treasuries that 
support Medi-Cal. I'm sure most of them would happily purchase health insurance 
or join an HMO, but simply can't afford to do so at the wages they earn. To cut 
them off as they work their way toward 
full citizenship is nothing less than cruel.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">It doesn't surprise me for a moment to see right-wing Republicans promoting 
this sort of legislation. It's implicit in their ''Contract With America.'' But 
I am frankly shocked and horrified to find Senator Feinstein's name behind it, 
and urge her to reconsider her position.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">LET'S LEARN FROM L.A.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Editor -- It's greed, stupid! Every time I see yet another opinion poll on 
traffic, raising bridge tolls, and public transportation woes, it transports me 
back to gridlocked, smog-shrouded Southern California from whence I came six 
years ago. There, the effort to achieve balance between population growth and 
traffic has long since been thwarted by developers who keep covering the 
landscape with more and more houses, with no 
thought to how their new development impacts the region.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Sadly enough, the Bay Area is following their example. Unless our regional 
leadership work together to limit growth, no amount of toll roads or car-pool 
lanes will help reduce our traffic problems and ensure clean air to breathe. 
Let's learn from L.A. and concentrate on quality of life, not quantity. That 
will be real progress!

</p><p class="body" align="Left">EPITOME OF EVIL
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Editor -- I'm confused about all the uproar regarding the picture of Richard 
Allen Davis gesturing to the family of Polly Klaas after the verdict was 
delivered.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">I think the publication of this picture was very appropriate. I must say that 
the picture enraged me when I first saw it, not because it was on the front 
page of the newspaper, but because it demonstrated to me the lack of compassion 
that this inhuman being could have. He was smug, disrespectful and despicable.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
Chronicle provided a parent the perfect opportunity to explain to a child of 5 
and older about ''good strangers'' (someone unknown by the child but known by 
someone the child knows) versus ''bad strangers'' (people unknown by either the 
child or someone close to the child).
</p><p class="body" align="Left">This picture does not teach a child how to ''flip off'' someone. This picture 
teaches children to recognize evil when they see it.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">.THE PHOTO
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Editor -- Normally, I am disgusted with what I perceive oftentimes to be shock 
journalism, but I agree with your column (John Diaz, June 15) that publishing 
the Richard Allen Davis photo was appropriate, given the subject matter. I'm 
often reading how people are offended by this or that in publications, always 
seemingly forgetting that life has its ugly side as well as what we would 
like to see in it.
