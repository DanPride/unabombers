</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> SCOTT KAISER; Scott Kaiser covers hockey for the Chronicle. His notebook 
appears on Tuesdays.  



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
With the current winter-like conditions, it's easy to forget about the 
drought-inducing weather that blanketed the nation this summer.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">One man who knows better than others is new Aeros assistant coach and director 
of hockey operations Matt Shaw, who nearly lost his offseason home in Montana 
as a result of the wildfires that engulfed the North and Northwest.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;It's our summer place, but we consider it our home because we've moved so much 
that it's the one constant,&quot; said Shaw, who along with his wife, Carolyn, bought the home in 1992.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Shaw's house is on an 125-acre spread in Hamilton, which is just south of 
Missoula near the Idaho border in the Bitterroot Range of the Rocky Mountains.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Normally, we would have been there until late August, but because school starts 
so early here compared to other areas, we packed up and 
left (in late July),&quot; said Shaw, who has a 6-year-old daughter (Clare) and 4-year-old son (Hayden). 
&quot;You knew there might be problems because it was such an uncharacteristically 
dry year. It looked dicey (when they left).&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Less than a week later, a fire raged through a canyon within one-quarter mile 
of the Shaws' residence and his sister-in-law helped move their horses and 
cattle to safety.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I was looking for a house here while phoning back (to Montana) to see if we had 
one there,&quot; Shaw said. 
&quot;But even if I was there, what could I have done? All we could do was hope.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Fortunately for the Shaws and others near the canyon, firefighters used 
bulldozers to dig a fire line, then backburned into the oncoming fire.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;They burned the fuel out before it really got roaring,&quot; Shaw said. 
&quot;It was 
about as close as it could get and fortunately we didn't lose anything, which 
wasn't the case for some of the others in the valley.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Shaw said 
<strong>unabomber</strong> Ted Kaczynski wasn't one of his neighbors, but area residents do include 
singer Huey Lewis and actor Christopher Lloyd.  And financial giant Charles 
Schwab recently built an 18-hole golf course nearby.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In addition to being in charge of the Aeros' defense and penalty killing, Shaw 
is heavily involved with new Aeros boss Dave Barr regarding personnel and 
contracts.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Dave's given me a lot of responsibility,&quot; said the 34-year-old Shaw, who was the head coach of the Quad City Mallards 
last season. 
&quot;I'm honored by that, and I've really enjoyed working with him. I've already 
learned a lot.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">It's been a good fit for Barr as 
well.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Matt's been great,&quot; Barr said. 
&quot;It's very comforting to know I have a sharp guy like that who works hard for me 
and the team.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Blood brothers - What had been a frustrating month for injured Aeros right wing 
Alex Vasilevski turned brighter Thursday when he learned childhood buddy and 
defenseman Sergei Klimentiev had been assigned to the Aeros by the Columbus 
Blue Jackets.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;It's unbelievable,&quot; said Vasilevski, whose eyes lit up like a Christmas tree when told of 
Klimentiev's impending arrival. 
&quot;We've never played together as pros, so it's exciting.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The two met at the age of 7, and they played together in Kiev until Vasilevski 
left for Canada to play junior hockey 10 years later.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I'm happy to come here,&quot; Klimentiev said. 
&quot;I know this is one of the best teams in the 'I,' 
so I'm looking forward to it, especially with my best friend here.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Psycho brothers - The legendary Hanson brothers - Dave Hanson and brothers 
Steve and Jeff Carlson - and Ned Dowd, who played Ogie Oglethorp, will be in 
Austin on Oct. 19 for a special screening of 
&quot;Slap Shot.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 1977 movie will be the closing attraction of the Austin Film Festival at 
the Paramount Theatre, 713 Congress.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Bring your toys.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Rough opener - The IHL season got off to a rocky start for Detroit as the 
scoreboard at the Palace of Auburn Hills didn't work for Friday's opener 
against Utah, then the Zamboni dropped hot water on the ice behind the home 
goal during the first intermission, leading to a 42-minute delay. Oh, the 
Vipers also lost 3-1.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In 
closing - Aeros coach Dave Barr had this reaction when asked what it was like 
to be a head coach for the first time after last Friday's 2-1 loss to Kansas 
City: 
&quot;I knew I'd be disappointed if we lost and happy if we won, so my expectations 
were met.&quot;
