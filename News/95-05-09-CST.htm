<strong>Unabomber</strong> Letter 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A letter received by a Nobel Prize-winning geneticist was sent by the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> on the same day as a package bomb that killed another man, the FBI confirmed 
Monday. The bomber sent four letters from Oakland, Calif., on April 20 when he 
mailed the most recent bomb. One letter went to Richard J. Roberts at New 
England Biolabs in Beverly, Mass., near Boston. The FBI said the contents will 
not be disclosed.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Attorney for McVeigh 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A new attorney was appointed for Timothy McVeigh, charged under a federal 
anti-terrorism statute in the April 19 Oklahoma City bombing.  U.S. District 
Judge David Russell appointed Stephen Jones as a federal public defender. 
McVeigh's original public defenders said they had friends killed in the 
explosion and could not adequately represent the suspect.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">President Clinton demanded immediate congressional action on his anti-terrorism 
package, disregarding Republican warnings that an FBI promotion could stall the 
legislation.  In a slap at House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the president said, 
&quot;Nothing can justify turning this bill into a political football.&quot; Gingrich had said Sunday that the bill could be slowed by Attorney General 
Janet Reno's decision to name Larry 
Potts deputy director of the FBI.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The wives of two Americans imprisoned for illegal entry into Iraq plan to leave 
Iraq this week after receiving no response to their requests to meet with 
Saddam Hussein to appeal for their husbands' freedom, Linda Barloon said in 
Baghdad. Barloon visited husband William and Kathy Daliberti visited husband 
David in the Abu Ghraib prison outside Baghdad on Monday.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Inmate Sues 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">An inmate at the Limestone Correctional Facility in Athens, Ala., filed suit 
Monday against Governor Fob James claiming that working on one of the state's 
new chain gangs violates his civil rights.  Michael Anthony Austin claims that 
chain gangs violate the 8th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits 
slavery and cruel and unusual punishment, and the 14th Amendment, which 
requires guarantees that citizens obtain due process of the law.
