</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Frustrated by a series of unsolved mail bombings over the past 15 years, 
federal authorities yesterday offered a $ 1 million reward for information 
leading to the arrest of a possible serial bomber known as 
&quot;<strong>Unabom.</strong>&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Named for his penchant for targeting university academics, 
<strong>Unabom</strong> is believed to be responsible for 14 bombings across the country that have 
left one person dead and 23 injured. Despite the creation of a federal-state 
task force, the bomber has eluded attempts to pin down his whereabouts and his 
motives.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Unfortunately, despite years of detailed investigative work . . .  we have no 
viable suspects,&quot; said Ronald K. Noble, assistant Treasury secretary for enforcement, at a joint 
news conference conducted by the FBI, the Postal Service and the Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. 
&quot;Law enforcement cannot end this violence alone,&quot; he said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Little is known about the bomber, although the bombs and the victims have had 
similarities. The victims usually have been university scientists or employees 
of the computer or airline industries.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Last summer, after about six years of dormancy, the bomber or bombers struck 
again, sending mail packages that seriously injured two prominent academic 
figures on different coasts.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In June, Charles Epstein, a geneticist known for his work in locating a gene 
that may contribute to Down's syndrome, had fingers blown off when he opened a 
package in the kitchen of his home near San Francisco. Two days later, David 
Gelernter, Yale's director of undergraduate studies in computer science, opened 
a package in his 5th floor office and sustained severe wounds to his torso, 
face and hands.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Yesterday, federal officials released new evidence in the hope that it could 
lead to a break in the case -- a handwritten notation believed to have been 
written by 
<strong>Unabom.</strong> The words say 
&quot;Call Nathan R -- Wed 7 pm.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Nathan R may be associated in some fashion with the bomber or bombers,&quot; said FBI Director Louis J. Freeh. 
&quot;Federal investigators also feel that Nathan R may have received a telephone 
call from&quot; 
<strong>Unabom</strong> in June, near the time of the last bombings, he said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bomber, authorities say, put considerable effort into the 
construction and display of several book-sized packages sent through the mail. 
Black powder was used in some of the bombs.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A letter sent to the New York Times had predicted the June bombings. 
Authorities say they think it was authentic because it referred to letters 
etched on some of the devices. Two of the letters were 
&quot;c&quot; and 
&quot;f.&quot; The letter and the last two bombs originated in Sacramento, Calif.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;While it is obvious we are dealing with a very clever, skilled individual, we 
are also dealing with someone with no regard for the lives of his victims or 
anyone who may be nearby when the device detonates,&quot; said Kenneth J. Hunter, chief postal inspector.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Noble, Freeh, Hunter and acting ATF director John W. Magaw urged people to call 
1-800-701-BOMB or 1-800-701-2662 if they have any information.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Progress is essential 
in this case because there is great concern that the bomber will strike again,&quot; Noble said.
