</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Each time the bomber officially called the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> strikes, he ignites a burning combination of fear, frustration and hope in the 
pit of Bill Foley's belly.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Fear that another unsuspecting victim has been maimed or killed.  Frustration 
that law enforcement resources have so far failed to stop the bomber. Hope that 
this time, amid the carnage, the elusive killer left the critical clue.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''It's sort of a sickening feeling,'' said Foley, who for 13 years has 
investigated two attacks at University of California-Berkeley in the 1980s and 
has worked with the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> task force on some of the 14 others.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Foley and other law enforcement officials have had their share of ups and downs 
in what the FBI calls the most intensive and protracted search in U.S.  
history.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Their worst fears were realized again last week with the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> latest attack in 17 years: a mail bomb that killed a Sacramento timber 
industry lobbyist, bringing the totals to 16 bombings, three dead, 23 hurt.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">But investigators' hopes were lifted after the blast by a rush of promising 
leads. The 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> sent two letters that described - for the first time - his avowed political 
motives: that society turn from science and 
technology, that corporations cease putting a commercial spin on reality, that 
people organize into smaller, autonomous communities.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Citizens, prompted by outrage or a $ 1 million reward, last week made more than 
2,500 calls to the Unabom hot line.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''It's a roller coaster of a case,'' said Jim Freeman, special agent in charge 
of the San Francisco FBI office. ''You've got this absolute roller coaster of 
emotion that this really might be the guy, and then other information starts 
coming in and throws cold water on that.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">One problem has been that nearly every bomb has exploded, making the trail 
murkier. A cautious recipient could both protect himself and help 
investigators, he said, but in last Monday's blast, timber association office 
workers actually joked that the parcel was a bomb before it was opened.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Still, Freeman and Foley are confident. The investigation has linked all the 
bombings to a single suspect, Freeman said, affirming the probe's focus.
