</p><p class="subheader" align="left"><strong>HEADLINE:</strong> MEDIA FACE A DIFFICULT DILEMMA OVER TERRORIST'S DEMANDS FOR FORUM 



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> By MARIA L. La GANGA and STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In his letter requesting a national audience for his rambling anarchist views, 
the terrorist known as the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> gave new meaning to the term 
&quot;publish or perish&quot; and thrust the media again into the quandary that has plagued it since the 
dawn of modern terrorism:
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Do you accede to the demands of the lawless to prevent future bloodshed? If you 
do, will it really prevent the loss of life? If you don't, are you responsible 
for subsequent violent acts? Does granting terrorists a forum for their views 
make the media an accomplice?
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;So we offer a bargain,&quot; the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> wrote to the New York Times in a letter published Wednesday. 
&quot;We have a long article, between 29,000 and 37,000 words that we want to have 
published. If you can get it published according to our requirements, we will 
permanently desist from terrorist activities.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">It is a tantalizing offer. The 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> -- the alleged mastermind of the longest string of bombings 
in American history -- is suspected of 16 bombings in 17 years, killing three 
of his individually targeted victims and maiming many. Law enforcement 
officials say the bomber may be unraveling psychologically and becoming more of 
a threat.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Editors and ethics experts said Wednesday that the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> has created a dilemma for media outlets caught between the duties of 
journalists and the responsibilities of citizens. In offering his deal, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> said his manuscript 
&quot;must be published in the New York Times, Time or Newsweek, or some other widely 
read, nationally distributed periodical.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Louis Hodges, a senior professor of journalism ethics at Washington and Lee 
University, contends that a newspaper or broadcast outlet should not make 
bargains 
&quot;with someone of this mentality -- particularly not knowing who he is. . . . The 
Times should tell him to go stuff it.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Yet Hodges acknowledged that rejecting the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> would carry its own risks -- not only for his potential victims, but also for 
the entire journalism industry. 
&quot;People would say the New York Times had an opportunity to put a stop to this&quot; terrorism, Hodges said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
decision to print or broadcast a terrorist's demands is easiest to make when 
the threat of violence is most immediate, when a terrorist points a gun at a 
hostage and vows to pull the trigger unless he gets a national pulpit.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Journalists are human beings, and, if a life is at stake, most of us will say, 
'I'll compromise my truth-telling or my independence' 
&quot; to prevent bloodshed, said Jay Black, editor of the Journal of Mass Media 
Ethics.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But because this bomber's threat is so nebulous -- he may perhaps attack an 
unknown victim at an unknown time -- and the media doesn't want to become the 
story, Black says the New York Times and other outlets face a tough choice.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Complying with the bomber's wishes could set 
&quot;an extremely bad precedent by alerting every other sicko or 
manipulator that news columns are for sale,&quot; Black said. 
&quot;This is journalism being held hostage -- it's an extremely unpalatable 
situation.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The New York Times' intentions and its decision-making process were the subject 
of speculation in newsrooms and living rooms around the country.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. said in the paper Wednesday that his paper 
would look carefully at the unfinished book-length manuscript and make a 
&quot;journalistic decision&quot; about whether to publish it.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;While the pages of The Times can't be held hostage by those who threaten 
violence, we're ready to receive the manuscript described in the letter,&quot; Sulzberger said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;But whether we publish it ourselves or not, we'll do all we responsibly can to 
make it public.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A spokeswoman at Newsweek declined to comment on the magazine's policy, saying 
only, 
&quot;We're obviously going to act 
responsibly, both as journalists and as citizens.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Abraham D. Sofaer, a Hoover Institution fellow at Stanford and former legal 
adviser to the State Department, said he does not believe that printing at 
least a summary and a chunk of the self-proclaimed anarchist's manifesto would 
be giving in to an unreasonable demand.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Why should you 
<em>not</em> print it?&quot; he asked. 
&quot;I just don't see what you would achieve in doing that. He'd still be free to 
kill again (whether you printed it or not). The reason you'd print it 
ultimately is because it's news.&quot; Sofaer was affiliated with the State Department in 1985 when a group of 
Lebanese Muslims hijacked a TWA jet and later paraded its hostages for the 
broadcast media at a press conference in Damascus -- a riotous event that 
former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger called a 
&quot;humiliation&quot; 
for America.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Terrorists have a long history of threatening harm if the media does not 
publicize their views, in effect holding newspapers, television and radio 
stations responsible for their own criminal acts.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">When newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst was kidnaped by the Symbionese 
Liberation Army in the early 1970s, her captors demanded that all of their 
communications be printed in full in media outlets. 
&quot;Failure to do so,&quot; the group warned, 
&quot;will endanger the safety of the prisoner.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In 1976, a group of Croatian nationals hijacked a New York-to-Chicago jet and 
demanded that five major newspapers publish their manifestoes beginning on page 
one or the terrorists would plant a bomb in a 
&quot;highly busy location.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The group had already detonated one bomb, killing a police officer in a New 
York subway station.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, the Washington Post and the Chicago 
Tribune complied as best they could by publishing the statements; but it was 
late on a Friday night and all of the publications had begun printing. The 
International Herald Tribune could not comply because its Saturday edition had 
already been delivered.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">More recently, Branch Davidian leader David Koresh promised that he and his 
followers would surrender from their armed compound in Waco, Tex., if an 
hourlong tape was played on radio stations. But after the tape was aired he 
recanted, weeks before the inferno and loss of life that ended the siege.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The issue is no clearer today. There is no consensus about what to do with the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> demands.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Shelby Coffey III, editor of the Los Angeles Times, defended the New York 
Times' decision to take a look at the bomber's manifesto and then make a 
decision.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;But 
I would be skeptical,&quot; Coffey said, 
&quot;because you're talking about making a bargain. When you're making a bargain, 
you have to know something about the person you're making a bargain with. What 
we know about this guy's background and credibility is that he has apparently 
perpetrated a string of bombings that have killed or maimed people. That's not 
the best background to be making bargains with.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Several journalists agreed that the bomber's demand letter, published in many 
papers' Wednesday editions, was itself newsworthy. And they supported the New 
York Times' decision to print it.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But they categorically renounced the bomber's proposed bargain: a forum for his 
manuscript in exchange for a pledge to quit killing people. Newspapers, they 
said, simply cannot swap column inches for a terrorist's promises.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;No deals with the FBI or the writer of the letter,&quot; said George Langford, public editor of the 
Chicago Tribune. 
&quot;You're not going to accede to their demands. No way.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">At the Sacramento Bee, which published the bomber's letter to the New York 
Times on Wednesday, ombudsman Art Nauman said he personally abhorred the 
thought of turning the newspaper into a forum for a crazed terrorist.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I'd tell him, 'The first letter was bona fide (as a news story), because it 
told us a lot about you,' 
&quot; he said. 
&quot;But we're not going to be part of your propaganda machine. We have law 
enforcement to take care of people like you.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mark Jurkowitz, media writer for the Boston Globe, noted that the letter 
published Wednesday gave insight into the motives and character of a notorious 
criminal whose public profile has been nothing more than a police sketch since 
he first struck in 1978.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But by welcoming the manuscript, he said, the 
New York Times 
&quot;could find themselves in a very tricky position, a pawn in the cat-and-mouse 
game between law enforcement and this guy, a situation where they might be 
manipulated by both parties.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Criminal experts were divided over whether it was good judgment to publish the 
letter and whether the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> longer manifesto should be printed.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Reid Meloy, a forensic psychologist in San Diego, noted that publishing the 
letter 
&quot;gives reality to the bomber's fantasy that he is larger than life, or more 
important than he actually is. That's not necessarily a good idea.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But others suggested that publishing the letter might have defused the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> tensions or satisfied his desire to win recognition. 
&quot;I think it could be quite helpful,&quot; said Charles Bahn, a professor of psychology at John Jay College of Criminal 
Justice in New York. 
&quot;And I think we should encourage him to 
write again and make his ideas plainer and plainer.&quot;
