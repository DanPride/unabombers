Now Bounty Hunters Can Make Out Like Bandits

</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">THE prices on the 
&quot;Wanted&quot; posters are going up.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Earlier this month, the Federal Government offered $1 million to anyone who 
helps crack the 15-year-old 
&quot;<strong>Unabom&quot;</strong> case -- the hunt for the bomber whose parcels have maimed and killed 
executives and professors.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> And last month, the Clinton Administration offered its second $2 million 
reward in the World Trade Center bombing case. It said the money would go to 
anyone providing information leading to the capture of Abdul Rahman Yasin, a 
suspect in the bombing of the World Trade Center who may have fled to Iraq. 
Over the summer, the Administration made a similar offer for information about 
another suspect, Ramzi Ahmed Yousef. He is also believed to have escaped to 
Iraq, although investigators think he may have gone from there to Iran or 
Afghanistan.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">While million-dollar rewards are still rare, the trend toward them seems to be 
rising much faster than inflation can account for. After United States troops 
were sent to Panama in 1989, President Bush approved a $1 million bounty for 
information that would lead to the capture of Gen. Manuel 
Antonio Noriega, who was hiding in the Vatican diplomatic mission. The money 
was never paid because Mr. Noriega gave himself up.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Some private groups and other countries have offered seven-figure rewards, 
including the Colombian Government's bounty earlier this year of more than $6 
million for the capture of Pablo Escobar, one of the leaders of the Medellin 
cocaine cartel. But in the United States, by and large, Federal and state 
agencies have posted more modest offers -- in the $10,000 to $50,000 range for 
killers and kidnappers.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">And private bounties seem to be getting larger as well. For many years, armored 
truck companies and art galleries have offered large rewards when they have 
been the victims of robberies. But a recent offer by the film star Winona Ryder 
of $200,000 for the safe return of a 12-year-old girl 
kidnapped at knife-point from her California home has struck some law 
enforcement officials as unusually generous. Like the girl, Polly Klaas, Ms. 
Ryder is from Petaluma and began her stage career in a local theater at age 12. 
She decided to offer the reward after seeing a segment about the case on 
&quot;America's Most Wanted.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">What has changed things? 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Officials say that high-profile, high-stakes cases -- like the World Trade 
Center explosion and the serial mail bomber -- put enormous pressure on 
investigators. And when the trail starts to grow cold, sometimes the only way 
to keep an investigation going is to tantalize the public with lottery-sized 
jackpots.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;A million dollars tends to wonderfully focus the mind,&quot; said John C. Killorin, a spokesman for the Treasury Department's Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms. 
&quot;It's a fair assessment to say that when an agency comes forward with a reward 
offer, it means that either the leads have run out or there are just too many 
of them out there.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The firearms agency is one of three Federal agencies, along with anonymous 
private donors, to jointly offer $1 million for information that leads to the 
conviction of the serial bomber. Mr. Killorin said it already prompted more 
than 1,200 calls offering tips, although the case still remains far from being 
solved. He said the agencies will divvy up the reward if more than one person 
offers clues that crack the case.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Do bounties work? Sometimes. Of course, governments have offered them since 
before the founding of the Republic. One of the earliest Federal laws on the 
subject was adopted in 1899, when Congress authorized the Government to provide 
rewards to anyone who helped 
turn in those who failed to pay taxes. And earlier this century, rewards played 
an important role in the Government's enforcement of Prohibition laws 
forbidding production or sale of liquor.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Because big rewards are rare and Federal and local agencies account for them in 
different ways -- most lump them in with their payments to street informants, 
for example -- it is hard to compare such programs. But officials say the 
largest is probably the Internal Revenue Service's program that gives 
informants a portion of what the Government collects (up to a $100,000 
maximum). Between 1967 and last year, the I.R.S. paid more than $21 million to 
recover more than $1 billion in unpaid taxes. Some rewards reached the full 
$100,000, and officials think those are the largest government bounties 
collected.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Civil libertarians and defense lawyers say they are generally less troubled by 
rewards offered to the public than by other kinds of inducements -- like 
payoffs to informants. Still, they are worried when the awards get so big that 
they encourage crackpots. They can also taint a trial when a jury begins to 
consider how much money was paid to help catch the defendant. The large awards, 
they say, can be big incentives to those tempted to violate civil liberties and 
privacy rights.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Vivian Berger, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who teaches law at 
Columbia University, said that because the rewards are usually offered to the 
public at large and paid only after convictions, they are not as problematic as 
payments to an informant who may have participated in a crime or to someone who 
can entrap a defendant. She also said that rewards, 
&quot;to the extent that they are not humongous,&quot; are less likely to 
&quot;skewer the reliability of information.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Still, some rewards 
encourage abuses anyway. Last year, the Internal Revenue Service received 
10,966 claims for prizes. It awarded 671.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Some of the complainants are people who are disenchanted with their neighbors, 
spouses or employers,&quot; said Johnell Hunter, an I.R.S. spokeswoman. 
&quot;They don't always work out very well. We don't publicize the program just for 
that reason. We don't want a rush of unhappy people ratting on their neighbors 
without cause.&quot;
