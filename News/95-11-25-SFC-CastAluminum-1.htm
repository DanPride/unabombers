FBI looks to college labs as possible source of explosives

<p class="body" align="Left">FBI agents on the trail of the UNABOM killer are now focusing on college campus
machine shops and chemistry labs, where the bomber may have fashioned aluminum
components and developed chemicals for his unique homemade bombs, The Chronicle
has learned. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Although the FBI declined to discuss its investigation, workers at several Bay
Area campuses said agents appear to think the bomber may have learned his trade
at the unwitting hands of university art department instructors or from
maintenance employees at campus machine shops. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
''These interviews are a logical outgrowth of previous interviews conducted
within and around machine shops in the (San Francisco) Bay Area,'' FBI
spokesman George Grotz said. The FBI said it was looking for possible suspects,
including former students or employees who may have had access to chemicals in
science labs or maintenance facilities. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
In the past 17 years, the <strong>Unabomber</strong> has been responsible for
three deaths and 23 injuries in 16 incidents in which bombs were mailed to
their targets or planted to explode and injure passersby. Eight of the 16
incidents were connected with Northern California.

Over the years, the <strong>Unabomber's</strong> devices have become more
sophisticated, made of wood and metal parts. The bombs have stumped
investigators trying to track down the materials. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
<a href="http://www.unabombers.com/#FCPin">At Sonoma State University in Rohnert Park, John-Scott Forester, a
technician in the art department, where students learn how to cast bronze and
other metals for sculpture, said two agents spent an hour asking him about
casting aluminum.</a>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
''The bomber has been making bombs out of aluminum cylinders, and they were
curious about the foundry process, where you cast metal for statues,'' Forester
said. ''They also asked if there were any people (who used the art department)
that fit the profile of the <strong>Unabomber</strong> -- they described him as
a loner who is very radical and very anti-technology. I couldn't think of
anyone.'' 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Forester said that most work in university art department foundries involves
bronze, but the FBI agents were ''very interested'' in aluminum because it has
a comparatively low melting point, about 1,100 degrees. This means, Forester
said, that the bomber could work his aluminum tubes with an inexpensive, easily
available propane torch. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
In the UNABOM case, so named because many of the early targets were either
universities or airlines, the agents also questioned a technician at the Sonoma
State chemistry lab, ''asking about certain chemical compounds,'' Forester
said, but ''we didn't have what they were looking for.'' Forester said he did
not know what compounds the agents were seeking. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
At the University of California at Berkeley, police Captain Bill Foley has been
chasing the <strong>Unabomber</strong> since July 2, 1982, when an electrical
engineering professor was injured after picking up a small box in Cory Hall.
Foley said FBI agents have been on campus interviewing employees at maintenance
shops, where machinery is fixed, as well as in teaching areas, such as
chemistry laboratories and the departments of mechanical engineering and
electrical engineering. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
''They've been conducting a wide variety of interviews with faculty and
staff,'' Foley said. ''It's a logical extension of the investigation, to see if
anything new comes up.'' 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Elsewhere in the Bay Area, two FBI agents interviewed school officials at the
College of Marin's Kentfield and Indian Valley campuses last Wednesday and at
Dominican College on Friday. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
And at Stanford University, a spokeswoman said two agents had been on campus
for the past three weeks, ''going to little machine shops where students build
projects, asking if they've seen anybody out of the ordinary.'' 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
At San Francisco State University, a spokeswoman said that ''agents have
interviewed people on our campus.'' 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
San Francisco State was the return address used by the <strong>Unabomber</strong>
when he mailed a package that killed advertising executive Thomas Mosser on
December 10.
