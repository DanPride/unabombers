</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the federal files on 
<strong>UNABOM,</strong> the meticulous serial bomber officially linked yesterday to two mail 
explosions that injured university professors this week, there is the curious 
entry of 
&quot;Ice Brothers,&quot; a book sent to the home of then-United Airlines President Percy Wood on June 
10, 1980.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A little-known nonfiction work on efforts of the Allied underground to disrupt 
German U-boats during World War II, the 517-page book by Sloan Wilson was 
delivered a week after an anonymous letter announced that it would arrive. As 
he opened the book in the kitchen of his Lake Forest, Ill., home, Wood set off 
a powerful explosion that left him severely battered and burned. It was the 
third of 14 blasts that have killed one person and injured 23.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Could the topic of the book help investigators identify the suspect behind 
bombings from 1978 until as recently as Thursday? Or was it another red herring 
left by 
<strong>UNABOM,</strong> who has no apparent motive and has left no trace of his whereabouts in 15 
years? Investigators said they haven't a clue.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;It's crazy,&quot; said Jim Cavanaugh, deputy chief of the firearms and explosives division at 
the Bureau of Alchohol, Tobacco and Firearms. 
&quot;There are more theories on this guy's motives than there are for JFK's 
assassination. In fact, we should probably start with Jack Ruby as a suspect.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Cavanaugh's comments reflect the frustration of U.S. officials at the 
reemergence of the elusive bomber who, until Tuesday, had appeared to have 
halted the bombings in 1987.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the latest attacks, 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> is believed to have targeted two university scientists widely considered to be 
among the elite in their fields: David 
Gelernter, 38, a Yale computer scientist, and Charles Epstein, 59, a geneticist 
at the University of California at San Francisco.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Gelernter was listed in guarded condition following a mail bomb explosion in 
his office Thursday that severely wounded him in the abdomen, chest, face and 
hands. On Tuesday, Epstein lost several fingers and sustained a broken arm and 
severe abdominal wounds when a package bomb exploded in his Tiburon, Calif., 
home. He was listed in fair condition.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">This week's bombings were not the first time 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> has reappeared after a hiatus, officials said. Three years separated two 
bombings at the engineering building of the University of California at 
Berkeley: the first was July 2, 1982; the second May 15, 1985.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Federal officials coined the code name 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> 
after the 1980 bombing of Wood, according to Rick Smith, spokesman for the FBI 
in San Francisco. Short for 
&quot;United Airlines bomber,&quot; the moniker also alludes to the suspect's penchant for targeting academics.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Forensics experts believe . . . that the maker or makers of each of these 14 
explosive devices are the same person or persons,&quot; Milt Ahlerich, who heads the FBI in Connecticut, told reporters yesterday in 
New Haven.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The relatively new possibility of multiple 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> suspects came from a letter to the New York Times postmarked from Sacramento, 
Calif., June 21, the day before the Epstein bombing. Yesterday the newspaper 
reported that the letter warned of an upcoming 
&quot;newsworthy event&quot; and identified the writer or writers as 
&quot;an anarchist group calling ourselves FC.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Cavanaugh said 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> has been identified as 
&quot;FC&quot; in letters to two earlier victims. But he 
cautioned that it could be a ruse similar to one used by Walter Moody Jr., who 
was convicted in 1991 of the 1989 mail bombing of a federal appeals court judge 
in Alabama. In letters before the bombing, Moody pinned responsibility on a 
white supremacist group.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;This is an Inspector Clouseau-type investigation,&quot; Cavanaugh said. 
&quot;We suspect everyone and we suspect no one.&quot; Special correspondent Arthur Chung in New Haven contributed to this report.
