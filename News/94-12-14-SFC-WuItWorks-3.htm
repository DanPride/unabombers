</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The serial bomber who killed an advertising executive in New Jersey last 
weekend is a highly disciplined yet vengeful social outcast who has a major 
problem communicating his reasons for a 16- year campaign of murder and mayhem, 
police and terrorism experts said yesterday.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''He is lacking in social skills and self-esteem, and may have problems dealing 
with members of the opposite sex, perhaps deriving from real or imagined 
physical flaws,'' two federal explosives experts wrote in a professional law 
enforcement publication three years ago. ''If he does interact, it may be with 
a woman younger than himself.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''His motive for the bombings is revenge, although this may not be apparent to 
any of the victims,'' FBI agent James Ronay and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms agent Richard Strobel said. ''The time span 
between the precipitating incident and the act of revenge may be quite 
lengthy.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A portrait of the so-called 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> killer began to emerge yesterday as a 30-agent federal task force tried to 
piece together evidence from the mail bomb that decapitated Thomas J. Mosser, 
the 50- year-old executive vice president and general manager of the big New 
York advertising agency, Young 
&amp; Rubicam. Mosser was in the kitchen of his home in North Caldwell, N.J., on 
Saturday morning when he attempted to open a package mailed December 3 from San 
Francisco, with a return address of San Francisco State University.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The lethal bomb was made by an elusive craftsman who is the central figure in 
the 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> case, named because the bomber's first four targets were universities and 
airlines. He is so hard to catch that authorities freely admit they have no 
idea who he is. He has left no clues that would narrow the 
search, and his targets have never been linked to any one person or group who 
had it in for them.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Based on a single eyewitness account, the suspect is believed to be white, 
about 6 feet tall, in his late 30s or mid-40s, with a ruddy complexion and 
reddish or blond hair.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Seven of the 15 incidents associated with 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> have ties to Northern California, where the federal task force is centering 
its investigation. A $ 1 million reward has been posted and anybody who has 
information is urged to call the toll-free hotline, (800) 701-BOMB. About 500 
calls had been received by yesterday, the FBI said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">One person who has apparently not yet called is the bomber, and it is this 
silence on his part that has investigators baffled.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''We have to acknowledge the fact that he has been very clever and unless he 
makes a mistake it will be very difficult to catch him,'' said Brian 
Jenkins, a terrorism expert and deputy chairman of Kroll Associates, a 
high-powered Washington-based investigative and security firm. ''But the one 
area in which he has failed is in his message. He has failed to communicate it, 
and he clearly wants to communicate.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">One way the killer has sent some sort of message is by engraving the initials 
FC into his bombs. Investigators say this could stand for anything from an 
unflattering reference to computers to the phrase ''Fight Control.'' Another 
small clue came from an incident in July, 1982, when Diogenes Angelakos, an 
engineering professor at the University of California at Berkeley, picked up a 
strange steel device that was on the floor of Cory Hall.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">NOTE FOUND NEAR DEBRIS
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bomb went off, injuring Angelakos. A scrap of paper found near the debris 
said, ''WU--IT 
WORKS! I TOLD YOU IT WOULD. R.V.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''We have run that WU thing every which way to Sunday,'' said UC Berkeley 
police Captain Bill Foley. ''We interviewed people with that name. We tried to 
figure out if it was left by the bomber, or if it was left by someone else. We 
ran all this down and really came up with nothing.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In June 1993, at about the time that Charles Epstein, a geneticist at the 
University of California at San Francisco, and David Gelernter, a Yale computer 
expert, were wounded by bombs that exploded two days apart, the bomber made his 
only written communication. The New York Times received a letter from a 
self-described ''anarchist group calling ourselves FC.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The writer promised to give ''information about our goals at some future 
time,'' but none was forthcoming. The 
letter was mailed from Sacramento and bore a Social Security number, which FC 
said would be the way he could be identified in future letters. It turned out 
that the number belonged to a former California prison inmate who had no 
connection with the bombings.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A writing impression lifted from the letter said clearly, ''Call Nathan R Wed 7 
pm.'' But nothing ever came of that lead, either.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">If there are any clues to be found, investigators say, they may come from the 
devices themselves. Explosives experts say the man making these bombs sometimes 
spends hundreds of hours on each one, carefully polishing pieces of wood and 
aluminum.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">'ALMOST AN IDEAL NEIGHBOR'
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''The construction techniques suggest obsessive/compulsive behavior that is 
reflected in his private life,'' the two federal agents, Ronay and Strobel, 
wrote about the 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> suspect. ''He may be a list 
maker, dress neatly and have a meticulously organized life style. He is likely 
to be quiet and would be almost an ideal neighbor.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''His post-offense behavior would include visiting the scene, perhaps watching 
the device function and the response of emergency and investigative 
personnel,'' the agents said. ''To relive the experience, he may keep souvenirs 
such as news clips or news videos.  His mood may be elevated for a time after 
the bombing.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He may be happy, but he is still frustrating the authorities.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''Each crime brings us a little big closer,'' UC's Foley said, ''but he's still 
out of reach.''
