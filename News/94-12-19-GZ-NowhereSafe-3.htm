</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong> 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">When the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> package blew up in Thomas Mosser's hands and instantly killed the ad executive 
in his New Jersey home Dec. 10, a retired New York City detective vividly felt 
the explosion. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Anthony Senft, who was maimed by a bomb planted at New York City Police 
Headquarters on New Year's Eve 1982, said Mosser's killing brought back all the 
traumatic details of the blast that almost took his own life. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;It rattles you, you don't sleep for a few days,&quot; said Senft, 48. 
&quot;You have a tremendous amount of compassion for the survivors.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Senft lost sight in his right eye, had five operations, skin grafts and 
suffered hearing loss from the bomb set by terrorists. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I survived, I'm really fortunate,&quot; he said. 
&quot;But it never subsides. I was affected when they bombed the Marine barracks in 
Beirut, and when a bomb blows up in Ireland it affects me.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mosser's wife and children were elsewhere in the house when the mail bomb 
exploded in the kitchen. It was the 15th such device sent by the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> - so-called because he has targeted university or airline employees - in 16 
years. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I feel sorry for them ... there's a rippling effect. Nothing's over for them, 
it never goes away.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The anxiety and vulnerability felt so strongly by Mosser's family and a 
firsthand victim like Senft reverberate in the minds of seemingly untouched 
citizens. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;We 
don't know how the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> has chosen the victims, so it is difficult to know who would feel most 
vulnerable,&quot; said Naftali Berrill, a John Jay College professor and forensic psychologist. 
&quot;He has targeted different kinds of people, so it's not just one group to be 
particularly panic-stricken. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Does everybody believe they could be a victim? I guess so, if he could do it 
for 16 years and not be caught,&quot; Berrill said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the 1993 World Trade Centre bombing and the Police Headquarters blast, 
public institutions were targeted. A mail bomb is more sinister, Berrill said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;It plucks us out of our normal complacency. It is sending trouble to your home. 
Here's someone who finds out where you live and intrudes on your privacy,&quot; he said. 
&quot;It leads us to ask, are we safe anywhere?&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Steven Davis, 
director of investigations for a corporate security firm, agreed: 
&quot;It's worse than the World Trade Centre. That we think of as preventable, 
because it was a car bomb that could have been intercepted before it went into 
the garage. But the mail must go through, and a mail bomb sends the message 
that we're not safe anywhere.&quot;
