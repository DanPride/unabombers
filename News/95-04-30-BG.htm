FRENCH UPSET 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong> 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The results of last Sunday's presidential election in France left pollsters 
confounded. Socialist candidate Lionel Jospin, who was seen by some observers 
as struggling to make it into May 7's runoff election, finished first with 23.3 
percent of the vote, the lowest share for a winner in recent history. 
&quot;I must admit it: This result surprised all of us a bit,&quot; Jospin said. Opposing him in the contest to succeed President Francois 
Mitterand will be Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac, whom polls predicted would finish 
first in this, his third run for the presidency. Finishing third was 
conservative Premier Edouard Balladur, whom Chirac edged out by just under 2 
percentage points. A record 15 percent vote for far-right, anti-immigrant 
candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen indicated anger and uncertainty among the country's 40 million 
voters.

Nation BEYOND THE BOMBING; FAREWELL TO A SENATE STALWART; REASSERTING SUPREME 
COURT POWER 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Last Sunday was a national day of mourning for the victims of the April 19 
bombing of a federal office building in Oklahoma City. President Clinton 
attended a memorial service there and called for broad new powers to combat 
terrorism. Civil libertarians expressed concerns about possible curtailment of 
constitutional rights. On Monday, the court-appointed lawyer for accused bomber 
Timothy J. McVeigh asked to be removed from the case, saying he could not 
provide an adequate defense because a friend had died in the blast. As the 
investigation continued, the city and the nation paused to observe a moment of 
silence at 9:02 a.m. on Wednesday - precisely one week after the blast. Bells 
rang, tears flowed and heads bowed as searchers stood amid the ruins of the 
collapsed building. The death toll stands at 
more than a hundred, with many remaining missing.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In a bitterly divided 5-to-4 ruling, the Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that 
Congress had exceeded its constitutional authority when it passed a law in 1990 
banning possession of a gun within 1,000 feet of a school. Making the decision 
significant was its being the first time since 1936 that the court had 
overturned a federal law on the grounds that it exceeded the congressional 
commerce authority. The decision is likely to inspire legal challenges to other 
gun-control statutes and, on a broader scale, signifies a marked departure from 
the court's lenient view over the past six decades of the legislative branch's 
authority to regulate commerce.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">John C. Stennis, a Mississippi Democrat who recorded the second-longest tenure 
as a US senator, died 
last Sunday of pneumonia. He was 93. During 41 years in the Senate, Stennis 
earned a reputation for fairness and finesse that landed him delicate committee 
assignments and close associations with eight US presidents. As chairman of 
both the Senate Armed Services Committee and the defense subcommittee of the 
Appropriations Committee in the 1970s, Stennis wielded more clout over military 
matters than perhaps any civilian but the president.

Business STOP 
&amp; SHOP WENT SHOPPING; THE GOVERNMENT SUED MICROSOFT
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> On Monday, the Stop 
&amp; Shop grocery chain announced it would purchase Purity Supreme supermarkets. 
The $ 255 million deal would create Massachusetts' leading supermarket chain, 
with nearly a quarter market share in the state, more than double the share of 
Shaw's Supermarkets, the next leading chain. Stop 
&amp; Shop currently owns 128 stores in Massachusetts, 
Connecticut, Rhode Island and New York. Purity currently has 55 supermarkets in 
Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Hampshire, as well as 66 Li'l Peach 
convenience stores. The deal is expected to be completed this summer, once 
government antitrust concerns have been satisfied.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Such concerns were not satisfied last week by Microsoft Corp. Saying it 
&quot;would likely lead to higher prices and lessened innovation&quot; in the growing market for personal-finance programs, the Justice Department's 
antitrust division announced Thursday it would attempt to block the $ 2 billion 
acquisition of Intuit Inc. by the software giant. Intuit is the maker of the 
leading personal-finance software program, Quicken, which last year held a 70 
percent market share. Microsoft and Intuit said they would contest the suit.

Living/Arts DANCING IN THE DARK
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Ginger Rogers, whose song-and-dance partnership with 
Fred Astaire brought the movie musical to unrivaled heights, died Tuesday. She 
was 83. Rogers appeared in 72 films, 10 with Astaire. Their teaming began with 
&quot;Flying Down to Rio&quot; (1933) and ended with 
&quot;The Barkleys of Broadway&quot; (1949). Rogers won the 1940 Academy Award for best actress for 
&quot;Kitty Foyle.&quot; Among her best-known films are 
&quot;Top Hat&quot; (1935), regarded by many as the finest Astaire-Rogers musical, 
&quot;Stage Door&quot; (1937) and 
&quot;The Major and the Minor&quot; (1942). In 1988, President Reagan noted the unfairness of his friend Rogers 
being regarded as the lesser half in one of Hollywood's most fabled duos. 
&quot;Her male counterpart got the lion's share of publicity,&quot; Reagan said, 
&quot;but Ginger Rogers did everything Fred Astaire did and did it with high heels on 
and did it backwards.&quot;

Sports THE MAN YOU LOVED TO HATE
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
Sportscaster Howard Cosell, whose distinctive style made him one of America's 
most popular and unpopular broadcasters, died last Sunday of a heart embolism. 
He was 77. A lawyer-turned-journalist, entertainer and provocateur, he 
delivered his commentary in a distinctive nasal twang peppered with 
polysyllabic words. His presence helped make ABC's 
&quot;Monday Night Football&quot; a broadcast institution, and his support for Muhammad Ali when he refused 
induction into the Army during the Vietnam War and was stripped of his 
heavyweight title added a new dimension to sports journalism. Cosell prided 
himself on his bringing the real world into sports. Said ABC'S Al Michaels, 
&quot;His dream would have been to go on the air for an hour, without any notes, and 
tell us what was on his mind.&quot;

In their own words
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> On Monday, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> struck again, killing the chief 
lobbyist for the California Forest Association in Sacramento. It was the 16th 
letter bomb he's sent in 17 years. That same day, The New York Times received a 
letter from him. As indicated by the police artist's sketch below, 
investigators believe the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> to be a single white man in his 40s, though he used the first-person plural in 
the letter. Excerpts from his letter follow.
 
&quot;The FBI has tried to portray these bombings as the work of an isolated nut. We 
won't waste our time arguing about whether we are nuts, but we certainly are 
not isolated. For security reasons we won't reveal the number of members of our 
group, but anyone who will read the anarchist and radical environmentalist 
journals will see that opposition to the industrial-technological system is 
widespread and growing.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">. . . We expect to be able to pack deadly bombs into ever smaller, lighter and 
more harmless 
looking packages. On the other hand, we believe we will be able to make bombs 
much bigger than any we've made before. With a briefcase-full or a 
suitcase-full of explosives we should be able to blow out the walls of 
substantial buildings.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Clearly we are in a position to do a great deal of damage. And it doesn't 
appear that the FBI is going to catch us any time soon. The FBI is a joke.&quot;
