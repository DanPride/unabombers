</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> Paul Leavitt 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong><p class="body" align="Left">A wind-whipped fire that has destroyed 40 homes and caused $
30 million in damage across 11,100 acres of California's Point Reyes National
Seashore won't be controlled until at least Monday, state forestry officials
said. More than 2,000 firefighters are battling the blaze, which officials say
broke out from an illegal campfire Tuesday. Fire crews worked feverishly
Thursday to keep flames from spreading to homes in Inverness, a 1,000-resident
community 25 miles north of San Francisco. In southern California, an 820-acre
wildfire destroyed two homes and several cars but spared hundreds of homes in a
new subdivision of Santa Clarita.

FLIGHT DELAYS: The Navy's Blue Angels, practicing for a weekend show in San
Francisco, grounded departing civilian flights for more than an hour and caused
a backup for dozens of flights into early evening, an airport spokesman said.
The Navy's ace flying squadron arranged with the FAA months ago to have
precedence over local air traffic. But that was before officials knew a runway
would be closed for repairs, said airport spokesman Ron Wilson.

SEARCH: Federal authorities trying to identify the Unabomber - blamed for 16 attacks
that killed three and injured 23 since 1978 - subpoenaed records of
transactions at Brigham Young University's library in Provo, Utah. School
officials wouldn't elaborate. FBI agents on the Unabom task force also are
reviewing 1970s-era school yearbooks and records at Chicago-area high schools</a>.

AIDS LAWSUIT: Armour Pharmaceutical Co. of Collegeville, Pa., has settled out
of court with three of six Vancouver, Canada, hemophiliacs who say they
contracted AIDS from Factorate, a blood-clotting product, The Philadelphia
Inquirer said. Terms: $ 1.55 million each. Documents at a government hearing in
Toronto said Armour was told in 1985 its heat-treating process didn't kill the
AIDS virus, but the company kept selling Factorate until 1987.

PARENTING RULES: Parents in Durham County, N.C., who wash a child's mouth out
with soap or leave an 8-year-old alone for more than half-hour could find
themselves under investigation by child-welfare authorities for violating the
county's new standards of parenting. Also on the no-no list: locking a child in
a darkened room, hitting a child anywhere but on the legs or buttocks, or
leaving a 12-year-old alone for more than four hours. County-set bedtimes: 9
p.m. for 12- to 14-year-olds; midnight for 15- to 17-year-olds.

FORMER CONGRESSMAN TO PRISON: Mel Reynolds, 43, began serving his five-year
prison sentence for having sex with a 16-year-old campaign volunteer and trying
to sabotage the investigation. As the Chicago Democrat arrived at the Criminal
Court Building he snapped at one photographer, &quot;Do that again and you're
going down.&quot;

BOMBING PHOTO: Oklahoma Natural Gas Co. sued fired employee Lester LaRue for
rights to a widely published photo he took of a dead baby in the Oklahoma City
bombing. Using a company camera and film, LaRue captured firefighter Chris
Fields holding Baylee Almon.

GRIZZLY RULING: Environmentalists seeking to block a plan to remove the grizzly
bear from the threatened species list won the support of a Cheyenne, Wyo.,
federal judge who ruled the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Grizzly Bear
Recovery plan doesn't establish &quot;objective measurable criteria&quot; to
determine how the rare species is faring.

TRIAL-RELATED SLAYING: Billy Veasey, 35 - whose brother was to testify today in
the Philadelphia trial of reputed mob boss John Stanfa - was shot to death in
his car. Police said it may be a mob hit. The trial was recessed. Reputed mob
capo John Veasey, 37, survived an attempt on his life before cooperating with
federal prosecutors.

Court to hear sex bias case 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
The Supreme Court agreed to decide whether Virginia Military Institute can keep
out women. The ruling also could affect The Citadel in Charleston, S.C., the
nation's only other state-supported, all-male military college. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond has said VMI may remain
all-male because a new state-supported women's leadership program at private,
all-female Mary Baldwin College in Staunton, is a suitable alternative. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
At issue: whether courts should view sex bias as seriously as race
discrimination. The 4th Circuit used a more relaxed standard, which makes it
easier for the state to treat women differently from men than to treat blacks
differently from whites.
