</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong></p><p class="body" align="Left">Fifteen states plan to raise highway speed limits when
lawmakers begin meeting this month, continuing a trend that began when the 1974
federal speed limit was repealed Dec. 8. The American Automobile Association
expects speed limits to rise in 1996 in Colorado, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas,
Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota,
South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Washington and Wisconsin. Eight states
already have raised their limits. Experts fear that states could start seeing
increases in crashes, fatalities and injuries by spring. The first
comprehensive look at the effect of higher speed limits won't occur until the
summer of 1997, says Chuck Hurley of the Insurance Institute for Highway
Safety. He says many states probably will consider adopting stronger seat belt
and drunken driving laws.

CAR EXPLOSION: Authorities don't have a motive for a bombing in Opelika, Ala.,
that injured a priest, but they aren't ruling out a connection to the <strong>
Unabomber.</strong> &quot;It's too early
to tell,&quot; said Opelika police Capt. Tommy Barnes. The Rev. Mike
Schnatterly, the rector at Emmanuel Episcopal Church, was injured when the
package he was lifting from his car exploded. Police didn't reveal how he got
the box. He was in fair condition in the intensive care unit of East Alabama
Medical Center. Opelika police, the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms are investigating.
