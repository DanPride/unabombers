</p><p class="body" align="Left"> THE twisted explosives genius behind a 17-year letter-bomb campaign that has 
baffled the FBI has written to the New York Times outlining his anarchist 
beliefs and offering to end his campaign if the newspaper published a 
&quot;long article&quot;, writes Ian Katz.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The so-called 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> who is believed to have sent the device which killed a timber industry 
lobbyist in Sacramento, California, on Monday, wrote to the newspaper the day 
before and said his ultimate goal was 
&quot;the destruction of the worldwide industrial system&quot;.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Chainsaw raids on $ 10,000 trees 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Washington Post - A BAND of chainsaw-wielding thieves is busy around 
Washington stealing trees whose black market value runs into thousands of 
dollars.  Their targets are paulownia trees, sweet-smelling specimens whose 
branches sprout heart-shaped leaves and lavender trumpet-shaped flowers in the 
spring. Known in Asia as the empress or princess tree, it is prized for its 
durable wood, popular in Japan for making musical instruments and ceremonial 
wedding chests. A tree can sell for as much as $ 10,000.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The long and short of it 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Newsday - A STUDY that is likely to have men hunched over rulers has found 
that the average penis, when erect, measures 5.1 inches long. That's more than 
three-quarters of an inch shorter than most previous studies have found.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The survey, by the Association 
for Male Sexual Dysfunction, discovered that, contrary to popular belief, less 
than two per cent of men have 
&quot;microphallic&quot; penises, which might require surgery to lengthen them to a more satisfactory 
size.
