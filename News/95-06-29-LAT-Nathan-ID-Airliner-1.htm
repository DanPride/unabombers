They have scoured junkyards for scraps matching parts he uses
in his bombs. They have used computers to search almanacs for anniversaries
that might explain the timing of his attacks. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
They have looked for clues in the movements of the stars and the moon, and in
the type of wood he uses to construct his devices of death. They have even
posted a $1-million reward, hoping a greedy acquaintance will be tempted to
talk. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
They have done everything, it seems, but catch the criminal they call the <strong>Unabomber.</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">

For 17 years, the terrorist who threatened to blow up a plane out of LAX has eluded authorities. 
 Despite millions of dollars, endless
man-hours and the most sophisticated investigative techniques available, the <strong>Unabomber's</strong>
identity -- and motive -- remain unknown. 
<a name="NoInterview"></a></p><p class="body" align="Left">
<a href="http://www.unabombers.com/#NoInterview">This week the
bomber upped the ante, warning that another of his powerful, meticulously built
creations would explode on a plane out of a major metropolitan airport. It is
not the first time he has targeted airlines. One of his bombs exploded aboard a
Boeing 727, and another was mailed to the president of United Airlines. </a>
<a name="kidding"></a></p><p class="body" align="Left">
But this week's maneuver is bolder, and
for investigators hunting the Unabomber, the escalation is frustrating indeed.
Perhaps most maddening, the Unabomber followed his threat with a second message
-- received by the New York Times late Wednesday -- that said he was not truly
planning to blow up a plane, but only wanted to keep the world on its toes.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">

&quot;Since the public has a short
memory, we decided to play <b> one last prank </b> to remind them who we are,&quot; said
the letter, which was authenticated by the FBI. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
At a news conference in San Francisco earlier Wednesday, FBI Special Agent in
Charge Jim R. Freeman refused to comment on specifics of the investigation.
Freeman said that about 150 agents are working on a task force searching for
the <strong>Unabomber</strong> and that the number may go up. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
The New York Times letter adds a new dimension to the case, indicating that the
bomber takes a certain delight in his lethal cat-and-mouse game with the law.
So far, he is far ahead in the contest, stumping authorities at each turn. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
&quot;This is a very, very tough case -- the toughest in memory,&quot; said
Herb Clough, former FBI special agent in charge of the Los Angeles office.
&quot;They've pulled out all the stops but still can't catch the guy. It's very
frustrating.&quot; 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Ed Gleba, a spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, agreed:
&quot;This guy shuts down the mail, creates havoc in the airports, scares
everybody. And he's probably sitting at home, watching TV and saying,
'Success.' &quot; 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Despite the terrifying nature of the <strong>Unabomber's</strong> newest
threat, experts said it will enhance what the FBI knows about the man.
Behavioral scientists will study his warning notes, published Wednesday in the
San Francisco Chronicle and today in the New York Times, for new clues in his
language and syntax, and will ponder his timing to see how it might fit a
possible pattern. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Extensive publicity about his threat may jog the memory of a potential <strong>witness.</strong>
And the more he exposes himself, the greater the odds that he will slip up and
be caught. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
&quot;The more we hear from him, the better the chances of catching him,&quot;
said Steve Higgins, who worked on the <strong>Unabomber</strong> case for a
decade as former director of the ATF. &quot;We learn more every time he
communicates with us.&quot; 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Although FBI agents were not talking Wednesday, outside experts speculated that
the latest threat may reflect the <strong>Unabomber's</strong> envy of
attention received by perpetrators of the Oklahoma City bombing. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Although the <strong>Unabomber's</strong> attacks have attracted increasing
publicity, they have not matched the level of coverage directed at Oklahoma City
suspect Timothy McVeigh and the carnage he allegedly wrought. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
&quot;He doesn't want to be pushed off the stage,&quot; said Reid Meloy, a
forensic psychologist who has tracked the case closely. &quot;He also may be
bumping up against . . . his own mortality, realizing that he may not have much
more time to achieve his grandiose goals.&quot; 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
James Allan Fox, a professor of criminology at Northeastern University,
speculated that the <strong>Unabomber</strong> is frustrated that his demands
have not been met. Before he sent the last bomb, which killed timber industry
lobbyist Gilbert Murray in April in Sacramento, the <strong>Unabomber</strong>
mailed a letter to the New York Times, declaring that he would stop his
violence if a national newspaper or magazine published a lengthy manifesto he
has written. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
&quot;He hasn't received the response he sought to his publish-or-perish
message, so he's turning up the heat,&quot; said Fox. &quot;He figures by
targeting an airplane, causing everyone to feel fearful and at risk, he can get
our attention.&quot; 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Whether the LAX threat marks a diversion from the <strong>Unabomber's</strong>
script is impossible to know -- because only the bomber himself knows what that
script is. But before he sent the bomb that took Murray's life, the <strong>Unabomber</strong>
sent letters warning of new attacks. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
This time, he has been far more specific, suggesting that he is becoming ever
bolder, said terrorism expert Brian M. Jenkins of Kroll Associates in Los
Angeles. He is adding a sick new twist -- attempting to play with his pursuers'
minds by suggesting that the whole affair is a prank. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
&quot;He is providing advance notice of when and where,&quot; Jenkins said.
&quot;It is consistent with a longer-term evolution. . . . He has become
godlike in his own mind. He can take life, he can choose not to take
life.&quot; 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Jenkins said this shows that the <strong>Unabomber</strong> is fitting the
pattern of other serial bombers, noting that they increasingly interact with
the media and &quot;acquire a sense of omnipotence.&quot; Their campaign of
violence becomes increasingly lethal, he said, and lasts until they are caught.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">

According to American criminologists, there has never been a manhunt quite like
the search for the <strong>Unabomber,</strong> who has killed three and injured
23. Some liken its intensity and scope to the search for the kidnaper of baby
Charles A. Lindbergh Jr. in 1932. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
The most similar string of bombings occurred in the 1950s, when a man named
George Metesky terrorized New York City with homemade bombs left at crowded
locations. Fifteen people were injured during his reign of terror, but he was
caught after seven years of attacks. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
One reason the <strong>Unabomber</strong> has been so difficult to catch,
terrorism experts say, is that despite his written claims to the contrary, he
probably acts alone and is not part of a larger group. That means there are no
conspirators who might slip up or grow disgruntled and talk. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
&quot;This is a lone individual who can cover his tracks and not leave much
information,&quot; said Jeffrey D. Simon, a Los Angeles author and editor of a
journal that tracks terrorism, called TVI Report. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
What is remarkable about the <strong>Unabomber,</strong> in part, is his
stamina, and the fact that he resumed bombings after long silences that led
agents to suspect he had died or been imprisoned. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
His methods are also extraordinary. He spends hours lovingly polishing the
parts in his bombs, and often uses wood and common household items that cannot
be easily traced. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
The <strong>Unabomber's</strong> first bomb was contained in a package sent to
the University of Illinois in May, 1978. By his third bombing, a pattern
emerged. In that attack -- an explosion on American Airlines Flight 444 from
Chicago to Washington on Nov. 15, 1979 -- a small fire forced an emergency
landing and sent 12 passengers to the hospital for treatment of smoke
inhalation. When the remains of the device were compared to an earlier bomb, it
was clear they were built by the same hands. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
One clue has befuddled the FBI more than almost any -- the use of the initials
FC, both on the bombs and in correspondence from the attacker. For a time,
agents theorized it stood for &quot;f--- computers,&quot; as many of his
targets had a link to technology. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
In 1993, the <strong>Unabomber</strong> spoke to the world for the first time.
In a letter to the New York Times, he claimed to be part of an anarchist group
calling itself FC. The message included a nine-digit number, a portion of which
accompanied the letter to the Chronicle this week. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Theorizing that it might be a Social Security number, investigators traced it
to a small-time career criminal from Northern California. They discounted him
as a suspect when it turned out he was in prison during several bombings in
1993. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
The New York Times letter also provided another clue -- the impression of a
message the bomber may have penned to himself on another piece of paper. The
message said: &quot;Call Nathan R Wed 7 p.m.&quot; Investigators painstakingly
pursued the lead, prowling phone books, driver's license records and other
files to <strong>identify</strong> people named Nathan with last or middle
names beginning with R. Ten thousand Nathan Rs were turned up and are being
interviewed, so far to no avail. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
After the April bomb that killed Murray, the FBI assigned 60 more agents to
temporary duty on the <strong>Unabomber</strong> task force. By Wednesday, more
agents were working the case. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Many of them are assigned to chase tips from the FBI's toll-free hot line
(1-800-701-BOMB), which has been swamped with calls. This spring, agents
searched metalworking shops in the Bay Area in an attempt to connect the
custom-crafted bombs with machine work. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
More recently, investigators prowled the Sierra for clues. In his rambling
April letter, the <strong>Unabomber</strong> said he used the mountain range to
test his devices. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
&quot;Eventually,&quot; Clough said, &quot;they'll get a break and this guy
will be caught. Either that or he'll get too careless and blow himself up with
one of his bombs.&quot;
