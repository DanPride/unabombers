</p><p class="body" align="Left">Two Allentown, Pa., teenage skinheads have been ordered to stand trial on 
murder charges in the deaths of their parents and brother. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The weapons used to kill Dennis and Brenda Freeman and their 11-year- old son, 
Erik, included a knife, an aluminum baseball bat, a pickax handle and a weight 
bar from an exercise machine, the coroner said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">David Freeman and his brother, Bryan, 
&quot;just lost it&quot; after their mother complained they were coming home too late, their cousin 
Nelson Birdwell, 18, told his lawyer.  


COURTS 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">MOMS JAILED: Two mothers involved in a Chicago case in which 19 children were 
found living in squalor last year were jailed for violating provisions of their 
probation. Sisters Mayfay and Denise Melton had agreed to undergo drug and 
parenting counseling after they were convicted of misdemeanor child neglect. 
But Mayfay Melton tested positive for opiates and was sentenced Wednesday to 
120 days in jail. Denise Melton was sentenced to seven days in jail for 
refusing to take a scheduled drug test and dropping out of the program. The 
children were taken from them after police discovered the appalling living 
conditions during a February 1994 drug raid. The 19 children belong to six 
Melton sisters.

posing as an 
abandoned boy in order to get cash and other help from charities has been 
sentenced in Rapid City, S.D., to nine months in jail. Birdie Jo Hoaks, 25, 
masqueraded as Nathan Devine, 13, even offering a letter from 
&quot;his&quot; mother saying she could no longer take care of the boy. Hoaks had received $ 
728 in cash and benefits before suspicious staff at a youth home called police. 


CRIME 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">- 
<strong>UNABOMBER</strong> TAUNT: The 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> taunted one of his injured victims for opening a mysterious package that blew 
up, calling him a 
&quot;techno- nerd&quot; in a letter. The text of the letter to Yale computer science Professor David 
Gelernter was distributed by the FBI on Wednesday, a day after another letter 
from the elusive bomber was published by The New York Times. 
&quot;People with 
advanced degrees aren't as smart as they think they are,&quot; the letter said. 
&quot;If you'd had any brains you would have realized that there are a lot of people 
out there who resent bitterly the way techno-nerds like you are changing the 
world and you wouldn't have been dumb enough to open an unexpected package from 
an unknown source.&quot; Gelernter was injured when a mail bomb exploded in his office June 24, 1993.
