<strong>Unabomber</strong> sends several letters;
 One says he'll stop attacks if national publication prints article

</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Federal officials said Tuesday that the mysterious serial bomber in the Unabom 
case sent several letters that were delivered Monday, shortly before a 
package-bomb explosion killed an executive of a California timber trade group.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Two were sent to victims of past bombings and a third went to the New York 
Times, which released the letter in early editions of today's paper.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> In it, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> claimed he belonged to a group that advocates breaking down society into 
small, autonomous units. Investigators, however, have said they believe he is 
acting alone.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> He offered to stop the terror campaign if the Times, Newsweek, Time magazine 
or other national medial organizations publish a 37,000-word article he said 
his group is writing. And he wants the right to rebut any criticism once a year 
for three years.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> His group's immediate goal, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> said, is 
&quot;the destruction of the worldwide industrial system.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
&quot;Through our bombings we hope to promote social instability in industrial 
society, propagate anti-industrial ideas and give encouragement to those who 
hate the industrial system.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The letter also discussed the December killing of advertising executive Thomas 
Mosser in New Jersey, saying his former public relations firm, 
Burson-Marstellar, had represented Exxon in the Exxon Valdez disaster. The 
Times said, however, that the accusation was not true.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Jim Freeman, head of the FBI office in San Francisco, refused to discuss the 
letters at 
a news conference Tuesday. He said all three were apparently sent from Oakland.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The bomber's latest victim was Gilbert B. Murray, president of the California 
Forestry Association, who was killed when the bomb went off in his Sacramento 
office. The package was addressed to his predecessor, William Dennison, who 
left the job a year ago. Wrapped in brown paper and held together with 
&quot;nylon filament tape,&quot; it weighed 5 to 6 pounds, Freeman said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Murray, 47, was the third person to die in 16 attacks attributed to the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> since 1978; 23 people have been injured.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Only once before had the bomber written a letter - in June 1993 to the New 
York Times in which he claimed to be part of a group and espoused an 
anarchistic philosophy. Agents said they doubt he belongs to a group and called 
that letter 
a 
&quot;trial balloon.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> got the name because he initially targeted university and airline officials.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> A composite drawing of the bomber was distributed after he was spotted 
dropping off a package in Salt Lake City in 1987.  Investigators believe he is 
a white male, probably in his early 40s.
