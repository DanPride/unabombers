</p><p class="body" align="Left">Federal law enforcement officials say they are still investigating the mail 
bomb that was sent to Dr. Paul A. Rosenberg at his Newton home in December 
1993, but are not close to making an arrest.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Although agents from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms have 
had a prime suspect for more than a year, 
&quot;leads are still being pursued,&quot; said Terence McArdle, special agent in charge of the ATF office in Boston.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">McArdle would not discuss possible motives or what leads are still being 
followed by investigators.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Dec. 19, 1993 case shattered the suburban calm of Rosenberg's neighborhood 
and was a jarring end to a week-long vacation in the Caribbean for Rosenberg 
and his wife.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Rosenberg sat down at the kitchen table and began opening a week's worth of 
mail. He turned his attention to a long, thin package with several stamps that 
were not canceled and bore a return address of 
&quot;Union of American Hebrew Congregation.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Rosenberg, who is on the staff at Children's Hospital and an assistant 
professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School, cut around the top of the 
package rather than ripping the end flaps. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">When he cut the top, he saw wires and cylinders - which turned out to be two 
pipe bombs - and grabbed his wife and ran from the house and called 
police. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Rosenberg referred all questions to Assistant US Attorney Theodore Merritt, who 
could not be reached for comment last week.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The so-called 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> sent letters to two Massachusetts Nobel laureates, Richard J. Roberts, of 
Wenham, and Phillip A. Sharp of Newton, on April 20, the same day a package 
bomb he mailed killed a timber industry lobbyist in Sacremento, Calif., 
officials say.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> is not believed to be responsible for the bomb sent to Rosenberg.
