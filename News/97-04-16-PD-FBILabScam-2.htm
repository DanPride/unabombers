JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SAYS RESULTS BIASED AGAINST DEFENDANTS 



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> By MICHAEL HEDGES; SCRIPPS HOWARD 



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>DATELINE:</strong> WASHINGTON 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Some of the major criminal prosecutions in recent U.S. history relied on 
tainted FBI laboratory findings that were biased against defendants, the 
Justice Department inspector general said yesterday.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">While clearing FBI lab officials of the most serious charges leveled by a 
whistleblower, the report presents a damning portrait of sloppy analysis and 
flawed trial testimony.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The inspector general found serious errors in the FBI lab's work in the World 
Trade Center bombing, the Oklahoma City bombing, the mail bomb death of a 
federal judge and 
&quot;several hundred&quot; other prosecutions ranging back to the late 1980s.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">FBI Deputy Director Bill Esposito defended the 
&quot;sensational work the FBI laboratory has done over the past 65 years&quot; but admitted, 
&quot;We're not happy to be at this point ... A good day is when we're not in the 
papers.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Attorney General Janet Reno said, 
&quot;Today's report does 
<strong>identify</strong> significant instances of testimonial errors, substandard analytical work and 
deficient practices ... but the FBI laboratory is capable of performing its 
mission to provide ... unbiased analyses that will help solve crimes, punish 
the guilty and exonerate the innocent.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Justice Department inspector general Michael Bromwich 
outlined these findings:
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Scientifically flawed testimony in several cases including the World Trade 
Center bombing, the Avianca airliner bombing over Colombia and at least one 
death penalty case.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Inaccurate testimony by an FBI lab technician in those cases and in the 
impeachment hearing of former federal judge Alcee Hastings.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Testimony 
&quot;beyond the examiner's expertise&quot; in many cases.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Scientifically flawed reports in the Oklahoma City bombing case and in the 
investigation into the mail bombing death of a federal judge in 1989.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Insufficient documentation of test results in hundreds of cases, including the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> investigation.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Also, the report found that the explosives unit in the FBI lab was staffed with 
people who were poorly supervised and lacking needed skills.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The inspector general recommended that several agents be transferred out of the 
lab, that lab 
supervisors be replaced, that the FBI bring in an outside expert to run the 
explosives unit and that the lab submit to independent accreditation.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 18-month probe, which culminated in yesterday's 500-page report, was set in 
motion in late 1995 when Frederic Whitehurst, an FBI scientist-agent who worked 
in the FBI lab's explosives unit went public with a wide range of charges.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">While the final report substantiated many of Whitehurst's criticisms, it took a 
shot at him for exaggerating allegations and questioned his 
&quot;common sense and judgment.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Whitehurst, who was placed on administrative leave earlier this year, is 
seeking his old job back, but the report concluded he 
&quot;cannot effectively function within the laboratory&quot; and suggested that the FBI consider what role, if any, he can usefully serve.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the Oklahoma City case, the 
FBI lab report on the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building 
&quot;contained several serious flaws ... all tilted in such a way to incriminate the 
defendants.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI agent who wrote the lab report, David Williams, 
&quot;failed to present an objective, unbiased and competent report,&quot; the Justice Department investigators said yesterday.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Timothy McVeigh's lawyer, Stephen Jones, said yesterday he had not read the 
report and couldn't comment. He has said he plans to use evidence that the FBI 
was biased to prove that McVeigh was set up as a scapegoat for the bombing.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Prosecutors wouldn't comment, but they already have removed the FBI's Williams 
from their 
<strong>witness</strong> list, and will have a British scientist present forensic evidence.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the FBI lab report on the Oklahoma City bombing, Williams made several 
judgments that appeared to point directly to McVeigh and 
co-defendant Terry Nichols, but Williams slanted his findings based on other 
evidence against the two, the Justice Department IG found.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">For example, Williams said the bomb was a mix of fertilizer and fuel, but he 
conceded that he reached that conclusion in large part because he knew Nichols 
had purchased diesel fuel and ammonium nitrate-based fertilizer prior to the 
blast.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Without the evidence of these purchases, Williams admitted he would have been 
unable to conclude that [ammonium nitrate and fuel oil] had been used,&quot; the IG report said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In fact, based just on the bomb site, Williams admitted 
&quot;it could have been dynamite&quot; that caused the explosion.
