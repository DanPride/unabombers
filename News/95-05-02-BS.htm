</p><p class="body" align="Left">An Arkansas banker charged with conspiring to hide cash transactions involving 
President Clinton's 1990 campaign for governor was to plead guilty in Little 
Rock today in the Whitewater affair, people familiar with the investigation 
said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Neal Ainley, former president of Perry County Bank, was to enter a guilty plea 
to reduced charges and will cooperate with Whitewater prosecutors in an 
investigation of Mr. Clinton's gubernatorial campaign, the sources said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mr. Ainley was indicted on five criminal charges March 1 for allegedly hiding 
cash withdrawals made by two Clinton campaign aides, including Bruce Lindsey, 
now deputy White House counsel.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">* The Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation into allegations 
that senior Agriculture Department employees illegally raised campaign funds 
from co-workers to support President Clinton's 1992 campaign and that donors 
were subsequently rewarded with more desirable jobs. 


Train derailed: 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Two engines and 15 cars of a Miami-bound Amtrak passenger train were derailed 
early this morning when it hit a tractor trailer that was stalled on a railroad 
crossing near Allendale, S.C. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Ten passengers and two crew members sustained minor injuries, an Amtrak 
spokesman said. The truck driver was not in his vehicle when the train ran into 
it. 


Offer to 
<strong>Unabomber:</strong> 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Bob Guccione, whose General Media International publishes Penthouse and Omni 
magazines, yesterday offered to print a lengthy manifesto for the so-called 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> the man held responsible 
for a 17 years of nationwide mail-bomb attacks that have killed three people 
and wounded 23. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In a letter to the New York Times last week, the bomber said he wanted the 
Times or Time or Newsweek magazines or 
&quot;some other widely read, nationally distributed periodical&quot; to publish an article of 29,000 to 37,000 words. 


Sex bias charge: 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A woman has sued the Metropolitan Opera Company for discrimination, charging 
she was dismissed in 1993 from her job as an assistant stage director because 
she is a heterosexual woman. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Martha Ellen Brennan, 48, said the executive stage director for the opera, 
David Kneuss, consistently gave better assignments to homosexuals, refused to 
hire other heterosexuals, gave her an unfair share of undesirable work and 
often made demeaning remarks about her sexuality. 


Execution ruling: 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A 
murderer begging for death may become the first person executed in Pennsylvania 
in 33 years. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals yesterday rejected a motion filed by an 
advocacy group on behalf of Keith Zettlemoyer, who is scheduled to die tomorrow 
night by lethal injection. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Zettlemoyer, 39, was convicted in the 1980 murder of a former friend who was 
scheduled to testify against him in a burglary trial. 


Gang arrests: 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Twenty-two people allegedly linked to a prison-based gang called the Mexican 
Mafia have been indicted on racketeering charges, authorities said. Nineteen 
suspects were snared in weekend raids, two were being sought and one was shot 
to death Friday in an unrelated crime. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The indictment and arrests are the culmination of a two-year 
investigation into the 400-member Mexican Mafia, accused of engaging in a 
criminal enterprise involving murder, assault, extortion and drug trafficking. 


For the record: 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Twenty-four Cuban refugees held at the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, 
were returned to their homeland after officials learned they had previously 
been deported from the United States for criminal activities, officials said 
yesterday. . . . Deputies in Los Angeles yesterday tracked down two more of the 
14 inmates who broke out of jail together over the weekend, leaving two still 
on the run.
