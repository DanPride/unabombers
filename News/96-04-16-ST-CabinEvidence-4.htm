</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> BY BOB ANEZ 



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>DATELINE:</strong> HELENA, Mont.  



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">FBI agents searching 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> suspect Theodore Kaczynski's cabin found explosive devices, addresses of 
corporate executives, maps of San Francisco, bus schedules and guns, according 
to an inventory released Monday.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In documents released in federal court, the FBI said it seized several 
unspecified documents and notes.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">None of the documents was identified as the original text of the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> manifesto, the 35,000-word tract published by the Washington Post and New York 
TImes last year. There were unattributed reports last week that agents found 
what appeared to be the original text of the manifesto in the cabin.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 34-page list of items found in the cabin was ordered unsealed by U.S. 
District Judge Charles C. Lovell.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Kaczynski, 53, was arrested at the cabin near Lincoln two weeks ago and is 
being held on charges of possessing bomb components. He has not been charged 
with any of the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> attacks, which killed three people and injured 23.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In its list, the FBI did not specifically link any of the more than 600 items 
to the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> or his crimes.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Dozens of the entries were for chemicals. A pipe bomb was found, as was an 
&quot;improvised explosive device&quot; in a cardboard box, and five guns.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The list doesn't 
<strong>identify</strong> the corporate executives or list the addresses.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">FBI agents searching the cabin found the prescription drug trazodone, an 
antidepressant.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">According to the manufacturer's label, trazodone is generally prescribed for 
people who suffer from 
major depressive episodes that last for a week or more. There is no indication 
from the evidence list whether, how long or how often Kacyzinski might have 
been taking the medication.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The list also described a hooded jacket, a blue zippered sweatshirt and hood 
and two pairs of plastic glasses. A 
<strong>witness</strong> who saw the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> plant one bomb described him as wearing a hooded sweatshirt and aviator 
glasses.
