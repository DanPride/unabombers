</p><p class="body" align="Left">PARAMEDIC OVERTIME: The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling that requires 
Chicago to provide overtime pay for its Fire Department paramedics, despite a 
warning that the action could affect city treasuries nationwide. The court, 
without comment, turned away the city's argument that federal law does not 
require it to provide such overtime pay for paramedics. A landmark 1985 Supreme 
Court decision said Congress has almost unlimited power to force state and 
local governments to comply with the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act, which 
sets minimum wage and overtime requirements.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In another decision, the justices turned down appeals from anti-abortion 
activists who say they wrongly are being sued as racketeers for blocking access 
to clinics and other efforts to stop women from having abortions. The justices, 
without comment, let stand a ruling that kept alive a nationwide, class-action 
lawsuit by the National Organization for Women and others against several 
anti-abortion groups and some of their members, including some in Chicago.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">STAMP INCREASE: It's official: Stamp prices go up Jan. 1. The Postal Service's 
governing board today voted unanimously to put the new rates--including a 32-cent first-class stamp--into effect at 12:01 a.m. Jan. 1.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">S.C. MOM INDICTED: A grand jury spent less than three hours today 
before indicting Susan Smith on murder charges for the drownings of her two 
young sons. Smith, 23, is accused of pushing her car down a boat ramp into John 
D. Long Lake near Union, S.C., on Oct. 25 while her children were strapped into 
their car seats. She claimed that her children, 3-year-old Michael and 
14-month-old Alex, were kidnapped in a carjacking. She made several tearful 
appeals on national television for the return of the children before confessing 
nine days later that she had drowned them.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">BOMB MAILED FROM CALIF.: The anarchist known as 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> mailed from California the bomb that killed an advertising executive, the FBI 
said today. The FBI laboratory in Washington determined that the bomb had a 
return address and postmark from San Francisco, agency officials said in a 
statement 
handed out at a news conference in the West Coast city. 
&quot;Details regarding the return address are not being released at this time due to 
pending investigation,&quot; the statement said. 
&quot;The postmark is still being reconstructed and evaluated.&quot; Evidence links Saturday's killing of Young 
&amp; Rubicam executive Thomas Mosser to 14 other explosions over 16 years, but the 
identity of the bomber and the reason Mosser was targeted remain a mystery.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">O.J. CASE: The judge in the O.J. Simpson trial today refused to remove a member 
of the prosecution team, rejecting defense arguments that a prosecutor unfairly 
had access to grand jury information. In a written ruling, Superior Court Judge 
Lance Ito said 
&quot;there appears to be no conflict of interest&quot; with Deputy District Attorney Chris Darden, who headed the grand jury 
probe of Simpson friend Al 
&quot;A.C.&quot; Cowlings. 
&quot;There is nothing in the record which would support any finding of fundamental 
unfairness or lack of due process,&quot; Ito wrote.
