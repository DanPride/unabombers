</p><p class="body" align="Left">BOMB SECURITY - People for the West has tightened security on the heels of the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> attack that last week killed the California Forestry Association's president 
in Sacramento.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">People for the West, a national, nonprofit group of property owners, resource 
producers and public land users, was launched in 1988 when the logging industry 
and spotted owl preservation forces clashed.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The mysterious 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> reportedly is a radical environmentalist who has maimed or killed several 
people after sending mail bombs over the past seven years. Gilbert Murray, who 
was the most recent killed, was a friend of the Pueblo-based group's founder 
and former executive director, Bill Grannell. The group has been talking with 
police and postal inspectors to protect its eight employees.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">AT&amp;T TAXES WRONG - Tax crusader Doug Bruce has discovered AT&amp;T Wireless Services incorrectly collected state sales taxes on air time from 
its pager customers over the past several years, and the state department of 
revenue has agreed to refund those taxes.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But Bruce says the tax refunds should cover five years, while the state says 
three.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Purchase or rental of pagers is taxable, but air time supplied by the company 
isn't, said Dorothy Dalquist of the department of revenue. 
&quot;They (AT&amp;T) collected the tax and paid it to the state. We were the ultimate recipient. 
We're obligated to get it to the proper people.&quot;

</p><p class="body" align="Left">NEW PRESS CHIEF - Greeley Tribune Editor Ed Otte has resigned to become 
executive director of the Colorado Press Association, replacing Mark Thomas 
effective 
June 1.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Thomas will become executive vice president of the Oklahoma Press Association.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Otte, 47, will be the fifth director in the group's 117 years. He served on its 
board of directors and was chairman of its convention and journalism education 
committees. He joined the Tribune in 1980 and has been editor since 1989. He 
teaches at Colorado State University.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">PROPANE CONVERSION - In an attempt to help improve air quality and increase 
engine life, Loveland officials are considering a plan to convert the city's 
vehicles to propane fuel - at a cost of $ 1,800 to $ 2,800 for each of the 
300-plus vehicles.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Lakewood, Thornton and Fort Collins have made the conversion already.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">BODIES RECOVERED - The bodies of a Bluewater Lake man and his 12-year-old son 
were recovered within five minutes of 
each other yesterday at Bluewater Lake in eastern McKinley County.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Divers recovered the bodies of John Rubio Sr., 30, and John Rubio Jr. about 
noon. Rubio's 9-year-old son, who was wearing a life preserver, was rescued and 
in stable condition at Rehoboth-McKinley Christian Hospital in Gallup.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Rubios were night-fishing early Sunday when their 8-foot-long boat 
capsized. Divers searched the lake from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Sunday and were 
back in the water by 7 a.m. yesterday.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">CAT HAS PLAGUE - A cat from the Farmington area is New Mexico's second reported 
case of feline plague in 1995, state environment department officials said 
yesterday.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The cat became ill April 24 and is recovering after being treated 
by a San Juan County veterinarian. A field investigation was planned near the 
cat's home to determine the extent of plague in area rodents. Cats and dogs 
should be dusted with flea powder to avoid the contagion.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Cats usually get plague by eating infected rodents and rabbits. They can pass 
the disease to their owners through infected rodent fleas on cat fur, through 
draining abscesses from infected lymph nodes, through infected saliva and 
through coughing.
