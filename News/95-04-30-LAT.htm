</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">And so the boys of summer returned to the ballpark last week, only to find the 
nation absorbed in a new national pastime: the bombing of Americans, by 
Americans and -- or so the bombers would argue -- for Americans.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">First came Oklahoma City, allegedly the work of right-wing extremists outraged 
over federal government excesses: 
&quot;What is it going to take to open the eyes of our elected officials?&quot; suspect Timothy J. McVeigh had complained to a newspaper. 
&quot;. . . Do we have to shed blood to reform the current system?&quot; This correspondence was published three years before McVeigh, authorities say, 
answered his questions with a big car bomb.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Not to be outdone by heartland right-wingers, a leftward-leaning serial bomber 
out here on the California frontier killed a timber lobbyist Monday with a 
letter bomb. 
&quot;The people who are pushing all this growth and 
progress garbage,&quot; the so-called 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> wrote the New York Times, 
&quot;deserve to be severely punished.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Criminal behavior experts suspect that the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> -- who is thought to have operated alone throughout a 17-year 
&quot;career&quot; -- was prodded to action by the Oklahoma bombing. Perhaps he was jealous of 
McVeigh's publicity. More intriguing, perhaps he took issue with McVeigh's 
political views and wanted to put his own into play. In that context, his 
bombing would represent a rather grisly tactical escalation in the debate over 
whom to blame for what ails America.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">*
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Certainly the pundits were willing to play along. On Wednesday, there was Rush 
Limbaugh Himself, entertaining a caller who argued that if right-wing rhetoric 
was responsible for Oklahoma -- as the President seemed to suggest in his plea 
to tone down the radio talk -- then left-wing rhetoric was culpable in the 
Unabom killing. Limbaugh responded cheerily that the same thought had occurred 
to him, though he was reluctant to start a 
&quot;my bomber, 
your bomber&quot; debate. A matter of taste, and all that. . . . 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In fact, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> and McVeigh would seem to be, as a former FBI agent put it, 
&quot;soul mates.&quot; Both probably see reflected in the mirror a little guy tired of getting 
screwed by the System, a patriot driven to ultimate action. Both probably 
assume all America would walk in their moccasins -- if only America had their 
guts.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Michael Rustigan, a San Francisco State professor with an expertise in serial 
killers, said, 
&quot;The more extreme members of the militia groups talk pretty much in the same 
language as 
<strong>Unabomber.</strong> The only difference is that for the right-wingers the monster is the federal 
government; for left-wingers it's the 'industrialist-capitalists that spoil 
nature and cut down trees.' 
&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Such people, he said, typically suffered a bitter 
personal setback in the past, which they twist into more grandiose crusades. We 
must kill the lawyers. Get the government. Exterminate abortionists. 
&quot;These,&quot; he said, 
&quot;are men with a mission, and they develop a community of support. They take 
their cues from those in society who they think would approve of what they are 
doing.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Cues.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">*
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Think now of a train, running down a track from rational debate to crazy rage. 
There is a coach for passengers who fear government has intruded too far into 
their wallet, or their living room or their womb. There's another for those who 
suspect corporate downsizing won't cease until we're a nation of part-time 
Wal-Mart clerks. And so on.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">This is not exactly make-believe. A Gallup poll released last week found that 
40% of the American people believe 
&quot;the federal government has become so large and powerful it poses an 
immediate threat to the rights and freedoms of ordinary citizens.&quot; Similarly, middle-class American incomes have been stagnant for something like 
25 years, and a decade ago, for the first time in our history, a majority of 
Americans began sharing the view that their children's future would be bleaker 
than their own.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Now put on board the experts of wedge politics, who for votes or ratings stoke 
the anger and fear. They keep the train loaded and running full bore. Of 
course, they will say later, regarding the awful wreckage, it was not their 
fault that -- unlike most passengers -- some people did not know to debark a 
few stations back. These crazy bombers took it all too seriously; they rode 
till the end of the line, around the bend, over the cliff. They were nuts. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">And perhaps this is so. Perhaps there are no lessons in these bombings. The 
demon-making of talk radio is harmless entertainment. The government is your friend 
-- midnight pay raises and similar adventures in representative democracy 
notwithstanding. The political expedient of dividing Americans, as opposed to 
uniting them, is without consequence: Everyone understands it's just a show. 
Right? So hey, forget about it. Turn on the tube, watch a little ball, let that 
old train rumble down the track. Chug. Chug. Chug.
