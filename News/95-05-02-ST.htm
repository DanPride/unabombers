Reports of abuse of elderly are up
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Growing numbers of older Americans are being neglected, battered or 
financially exploited by their children or other caretakers, according to 
federally funded research. According to the National Center on Elder Abuse, 
which is based at the American Public Welfare Association and funded by a $ 1 
million federal grant, reports of domestic abuse against elderly Americans 
increased from 117,000 in 1986 to 241,000 in 1994. But the reported cases are 
believed to represent only a fraction of abuse and neglect cases.

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The effort by the nation's governors and state legislators to call a 
first-ever 
&quot;Conference of the States&quot; to limit federal power hit a wall. The first stage of the conference was 
canceled because of grass-roots opposition from left- and right-wing groups.  
Only 14 states approved the call for such a meeting; 26 states are necessary. 
Suggested topics for the meeting included allowing states to originate 
constitutional amendments or allowing two-thirds of the states to phase out a 
law passed by Congress.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> More money was raised - and spent - in congressional races during the 1994 
election than ever before, the Federal Election Commission said. In all, 
congressional candidates raised $ 740.6 million and spent $ 724 million, 
breaking the records established 
in both categories in 1992. The FEC said candidates raised 12 percent more in 
1994 than they did in 1992 and spent 6 percent more. The surge was almost 
one-sided - Democratic fund-raising and spending went down, but GOP increases 
more than made up for it.

matching 300 students from 29 states. A team from Taylor Allderdice High School 
in Pittsburgh placed second. A team from Mira Loma High School in Sacramento, 
Calif., finished third, and fourth place went to a team from the Armand Hammer

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> G. Gordon Liddy, the Watergate burglar and talk-radio personality who advised 
listeners to shoot for the head if attacked by federal agents, was to be the 
honored guest today at Sen. Alfonse D'Amato's gala Republican fund-raiser in 
Washington, D.C., but the invitation was suddenly pulled. Liddy had been slated 
to appear at the GOP's 
&quot;Salute to Talk Radio,&quot; a private affair for about 400 big donors to the National Republican 
Senatorial Committee, a political money-raising organization chaired by D'Amato.

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> manifesto will be printed in Penthouse magazine if that will save lives, says 
publisher Bob Guccione. In a letter last 
week to the New York Times, the person claiming to be the bomber promised to 
stop his 17-year reign of terror if a major media outlet published his lengthy 
manifesto. Guccione urged the mail-bomb terrorist in an open letter to 
&quot;contact me at your earliest convenience.&quot;
