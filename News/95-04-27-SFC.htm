<strong>Unabomber's</strong> Demand Poses Familiar Dilemma for Journalists 



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> Bill Wallace, Chronicle Staff Writer 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong></p><p class="body" align="Left">By demanding that the New York Times publish a 35,000-word political 
communique, the mysterious 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> is attempting to extort from the media a direct line of communication with the 
public.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">It is a well-established technique used by terrorist groups, and mass 
communications experts say it is fraught with ethical dilemmas for the media.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In a letter received by the Times earlier this week, the terrorist known as the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> promised to stop his 17-year practice of mailing explosive devices to his 
victims if the Times, Newsweek or Time magazine publishes his lengthy 
''anarchist'' manifesto.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''We have a long article, between 29,000 and 37,000 words, that we want to have 
published,'' the bomber said in a letter issued under the name ''terrorist 
group FC.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''If you can get it published according to our requirements we will permanently 
desist from terrorist activities . . . If the answer is satisfactory, we will 
finish typing the manuscript and send it to you. If the answer is 
unsatisfactory, we will start building our next bomb.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Times said that while its pages ''can't be held hostage by those who 
threaten violence, it is willing to review the bomber's manuscript and ''make a 
journalistic decision about whether to publish it.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bomber's demand is hardly original: during the last four decades, 
terrorists on both the left and right have frequently threatened violence in 
order to force newspapers and electronic media to publicize their demands.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the late 1960s and early 1970s, rag-tag collections of 
left- wing terrorist groups, including the New World Liberation Front, 
Environmental Liberation Front and the Emiliano Zapata Unit, bombed electric 
power utilities, businesses and the homes and offices of public officials.  In 
the 1980s, a right-wing bomber who went by the name ''Shiva'' bombed two bank 
branches and a telephone company office.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In almost every case, the bombers issued communiques with demands that they be 
published in full or broadcast on radio and television. ''Shiva'' -- a deranged 
vet named Howard Henton -- even phoned a local newspaper to give an interview.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Although the underground press printed many of the communiques in their 
entirety, most mainstream newspapers published only excerpts.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In perhaps the most highly publicized case, a group called the Symbionese 
Liberation Army kidnapped 
newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst from her home in Berkeley in 1974 and 
threatened to kill her if the San Francisco Examiner, owned by her family, did 
not run its political messages in their entirety.  The Examiner complied.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Sig Gissler, a journalism professor at Columbia University and former editor of 
the Milwaukee Journal newspaper, said such attempts to extort media coverage 
pose a delicate ethical quandary for newspapers, radio and television outlets.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''You always run the serious risk of feeding the mental disturbance behind this 
kind of stuff,'' Gissler said. ''You have to weigh the possibility that you are 
supporting the terrorists themselves by publishing their materials. That's why 
most of the media doesn't report on bomb threats.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Extremists' efforts to harness the media can also backfire, because their 
repeated contacts with the media can provide investigators with clues, law 
enforcement officials say.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''In my own 
experience, when a person who is in the background starts coming forward for 
more recognition, or wants to talk, it's a sign he is looking for 
communication,'' said Ed Gleba, a spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco 
and Firearms in San Francisco. ''What's next? He might call you, or call a 
reporter. When that happens, clues start popping up . . . If this guy slips up, 
we've got him.''
