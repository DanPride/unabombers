Gates Seeks Friendlier Legal Turf

</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Faced with U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's damning antitrust 
verdict and breakup order, Microsoft will move quickly to shift its case to 
what it hopes will be the friendlier turf of the U.S. Court of Appeals in the 
District of Columbia.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Indeed, the appeals court is considered potentially so much friendlier that 
the Department of Justice -- with Judge Jackson's encouragement -- may attempt 
to invoke a little-used procedure to bypass the appeals court and take the case 
directly to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates seemed almost relieved that the case was finally 
out of Jackson's court, calling yesterday's ruling 
&quot;the first day of the rest of this case.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Gates announced that he will immediately request a stay on the so-called 
conduct remedies.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> How the appeals court rules on that request could signal its posture toward 
the case. More 
important, legal experts said, a stay could quash any effort to short-circuit 
the case to the Supreme Court.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
&quot;The logic of a stay is that it is less likely that the Supreme Court will take 
the case if the D.C. appeals court is engaged substantively in the matter,&quot; said Daniel M. Wall, a partner at the San Francisco law firm Latham 
&amp; Watkins.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> But legal experts said it is unlikely the case will go directly to the high 
court, given its focus on narrow issues of law and distaste for taking huge 
cases that have not already been thoroughly sifted by the lower courts.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The 10-member appeals court -- from which a three-judge panel would be drawn 
at random to hear the Microsoft case -- is considered one of the country's most 
conservative. A majority of its judges were appointed by Republican presidents 
Ronald Reagan and George Bush.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The court includes Judge Douglas H. Ginsberg, schooled at the University of 
Chicago, the academic nerve center of free-market antitrust thinking that has 
shifted antitrust law in a much less interventionist direction over the past 
three decades.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The D.C. Court of Appeals is also considered one of the nation's most 
sophisticated, handling many cases dealing with the arcane technicalities and 
applications of federal regulation.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
&quot;This is a court which has, even more so than other courts of appeal, a roster 
of highly intelligent judges used to dealing with pretty complicated factual 
and legal issues,&quot; said Joe Sims, a partner at the Washington law firm Jones, Day. 
&quot;So if you're interested in getting the right answer, assuming there is one, 
this is the court you'd like to see it go to, which is more likely than most to 
produce the legally correct answer.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The D.C. Court of Appeals also is the court that overturned Judge Jackson in a 
3-to-2 ruling for Microsoft in 1998 -- just before the current case began.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The appeals court held that Microsoft did not violate a 1995 consent decree by 
incorporating its Web browser, Internet Explorer, into its Windows operating 
system -- the very heart of the current antitrust case.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
&quot;It's a pretty conservative court,&quot; Wall said. 
&quot;I think the betting is that Microsoft would be very unlikely on appeal to draw 
a panel that didn't contain at least one quite conservative judge that the 
government would have little prospect of persuading.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Still, if the Microsoft case has demonstrated anything, ideology is a poor 
predictor of how people view the company's behavior. Judge Jackson was a Reagan 
appointee. Judge Robert Bork, a Chicago-school antitrust scholar, is among 
Microsoft's most vociferous critics.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Moreover, Jackson's ruling was so 
unambiguous that the software giant faces an uphill battle on appeal, even 
though Gates insists that Microsoft will ultimately prevail.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Appeals courts seldom overturn a lower court's findings of fact unless they 
are clearly erroneous, and Judge Jackson's fact findings hold that Microsoft 
illegally abused its monopoly in the Windows computer operating system to foist 
its other products on consumers and elbow out competitors.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
&quot;One of the most important things is the record,&quot; said Ed Black, president of the Computer and Communications Industry 
Association, a vocal Microsoft critic. 
&quot;And here we have a very exhaustive 412 findings of fact, so there is a very, 
very powerful record, and Microsoft has lost on the facts overwhelmingly.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Microsoft's chief line of attack will focus on Judge Jackson's findings of 
law, which are more open to re-examination.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
&quot;On legal conclusions, 
courts reverse all the time, and that would not be horribly surprising,&quot; Sims said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Arguments could focus on such questions as whether a breakup is workable, 
whether it is properly aimed at Microsoft's contested behavior, and whether it 
is 
&quot;disruptive or disabling to the defendant&quot; in reaching that goal, Sims said. 
&quot;If that's the standard they use, you can see there's a lot of room for argument 
on all those points.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> One of Microsoft's chief arguments -- won at the D.C. Appeals Court once 
before -- is that it should not be illegal to incorporate new products, such as 
its Web browser, into Windows.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Wall called that argument 
&quot;the strongest point without a doubt,&quot; noting that Judge Jackson went so far as to state that the appeals court had 
wrongly overturned him on that point.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
&quot;That is very central to this case,&quot; Wall said. 
&quot;It's not some backwater issue, and here the odds favor Microsoft. The whole 
notion that integrating 
new functions into a product could be illegal is contrary to most existing 
authority.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> But Black contends that Microsoft's chances on appeal are dim because it will 
not have an opportunity to reargue the entire case. Black said the appellate 
court need only find that Judge Jackson 
&quot;did a sensible job of using facts and judgment,&quot; and if that is the case, 
&quot;the presumption is his ruling stands.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Some contend that Jackson's brusque dismissal of hearings on the proposal to 
break up the company -- the most radical remedy in antitrust law -- could 
invite scrutiny.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">----------------------------------------------------
</p><p class="body" align="Left">THOSE WHO SIT IN JUDGMENT
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The District of Columbia Court of Appeals will be the next court to hear pleas 
in the Microsoft antitrust case. It is among the country's most conservative 
courts and is considered one of the most sophisticated as well, regularly 
handling complex litigation in federal regulation and antitrust.
