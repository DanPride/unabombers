<strong>Unabomber</strong> to letter at Beverly lab;

</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A threatening letter received by a Nobel Prize-winning scientist in Beverly 
was sent by the man known as the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> on the same day that his latest bomb killed a timber industry lobbyist in 
Sacramento, Calif., the FBI said yesterday.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The letter sent to Richard J. Roberts, a Massachusetts geneticist, was one of 
four mailed April 20 in Oakland, the FBI said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">That same day, a package sent by the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> exploded and killed Gilbert Murray, president of the American Forestry 
Association in California.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Boston Herald reported today that Phillip A. Sharp, a Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology geneticist who shared the Nobel Prize with Roberts, 
also received a letter from the 
<strong>Unabomber.</strong> Reached at his Newton home last night, Sharp, 51, would neither confirm nor 
deny the report.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Dubbed 
&quot;<strong>Unabomber&quot;</strong> by authorities, the man who has managed to elude investigators since his first 
attack in 1978 has killed three people and injured 23 others. Another 
geneticist, Dr. Charles Epstein of the University of California at San 
Francisco, was injured by a bomb sent to his home June 22, 1993.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Roberts, 51, who works at New England Biolabs in Beverly, has referred all 
questions about the letter to the FBI and obtained an unlisted phone number.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The lights in Roberts' rustic Wenham home were turned 
out last night, and a utility vehicle blocked the long gravel driveway. A man 
who answered the door told a reporter, 
&quot;Leave now, or I shall call the police.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A native of Derby, England, Roberts shared a 1993 Nobel Prize with Sharp for 
their pioneering work in biotechnology. They independently discovered that 
individual genes, the building blocks of hereditary material, can be spread 
over separate segments of DNA.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Roberts is the third of the four recipients of the April 20 letters to be 
identified. The Globe reported Sunday he had received the letter and the FBI 
was probing a possible link to the 
<strong>Unabomber.</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">FBI spokesman Jim Freeman would not disclose contents of the letter. He said 
the FBI determined it had been written by the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> because he mentioned Roberts in another letter to The New York Times.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In that letter, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> lashed 
out at scientists and said he would stop the bombings if The Times or Newsweek 
or Time magazines printed his manifesto. Only Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione 
has agreed to publish such a piece.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Times published the letter, with some sections deleted at the request of 
the FBI.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In another letter sent the same day, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> taunted a previous victim, computer scientist David Gelernter of Yale, who was 
seriously injured in 1993.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;People with advanced degrees aren't as smart as they think they are,&quot; that letter began. 
&quot;If you'd had any brains you would have realized that there are a lot of people 
out there who resent bitterly the way techno-nerds like you are changing the 
world and you wouldn't have been dumb enough to open an unexpected package from 
an unknown source.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Authorities have described the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> as a man in his 40s. Even though he referred to himself as 
&quot;we&quot; in his letter to The Times, the 
FBI believes he works alone.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the wake of the Sacramento killing, FBI officials said it appeared the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> was jealous of the attention created by the Oklahoma City bombing and he 
seemed to be unraveling.
