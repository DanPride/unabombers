</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Conde Nast insiders closely eyeballing Steve Florio's sitdown with Donald Trump 

in Conde Nast's curvaceous cafeteria this week suspected it wasn't just a meal 

between old pals.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">While Florio chalked the meeting up to a longstanding friendship, company 

insiders buzzed that it was more of a peacekeeping mission.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Florio's invitation was said to be an attempt to placate The Donald for cutting 

remarks made about him by the cafeteria's world-famous architect,Frank Gehry.  



</p><p class="body" align="Left">Gehry recently said he's working with Guggenheim Museum director Thomas Krens 

to bring a Guggenheim branch to the Hudson River waterfront. Two days before 

the Trump lunch, Gehry was interviewed by New Yorker architecture critic Paul 

Goldberger, who has profiled Gehry in the new Vanity Fair. In that 

conversation, Gehry told Goldberger he'd turned down design commissions from 

Trump several times this year - and three weeks ago told Trump he'd never work 

for him.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Next thing cafeteria diners knew, Trump was munching in their midst.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Florio was out of the office yesterday, but spokeswoman Maurie Perl said, 

&quot;the lunch was arranged prior [to the interview]. These are two isolated 

incidents. They could have just as easily gone to The Four Seasons, where they 

usually have lunch.&quot;

</p><p class="body" align="Left">STANDARD ELEVATION

</p><p class="body" align="Left">James Ledbetter gets a corporate apartment 

in London, and his bosses at The Industry Standard get a headache.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Ledbetter is departing as chief of the hyper-successful magazine's New York 

bureau to spread the gospel of the self-labeled 

&quot;newsmagazine of the Internet economy&quot; as top editor of a new European edition.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Editor in chief Jonathan Weber has been back at home base in San Francisco 

trying to decide how to fill the coveted slot at the magazine, which has 

greatly expanded its Silicon Alley outpost during Ledbetter's tenure.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The internal favorite is said to be Thomas Goetz, who gave up a byline at The 

Wall Street Journal for the 2-year-old Web-watcher. But Weber is also 

contemplating a different editorial plum for Goetz, and is talking to a 

&quot;short list of prominent external candidates&quot; about the New York post as well, 

a staffer said.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;It's all happening inside the head of Jonathan Weber,&quot; demurred Goetz.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;A lot of intellectual spade work is being done in terms of how to configure the 

New York office,&quot; Ledbetter said. 

&quot;It may not be one single person.&quot;

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Ledbetter, of course, has his own headache - the complaint filed by New York 

Press CEO and editor in chief Russ Smith over Ledbetter's use of 

newyorkpress.net for his independent, New York-centric news aggregator Web 

site. Greedily consumed by fourth-estate insiders, it now disclaims 

&quot;Not affiliated with the New York Press Association, nor the weekly New York 

Press.&quot;

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Ledbetter has filed a counter claim against Smith. 

&quot;There's supposed to be a decision before I leave&quot; by late May, he said. 

&quot;I could certainly still cover [the New York media] from London, since the 

papers hit the Web by 7 a.m.&quot;

</p><p class="body" align="Left">CUTTING TO CHASE

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Former Talk magazine and New York Observer editor Lisa Chase is going 

entrepreneurial.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Together with former Outside magazine colleague Laura Hohnhold, Chase is 

starting an outfit that will provide editorial expertise to book publishing and 

media companies.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Chase, who's already been consulting on Offspring, Hearst and Dow Jones' new 

Smart Money parenting spinoff, left Talk after a disagreement with editor in 

chief Tina Brown over a 

<strong>Unabomber</strong> article Chase was editing.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Chase and Hohnhold are calling their firm The Editor's Room - The E.R., for 

short. That's what it says on their letterhead.
