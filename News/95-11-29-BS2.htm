</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">It has become much easier in recent years to be conscientious about recycling. 
Just ask Blythe Danner, the actress who is starring in the Manhattan Theater 
Club production of 
&quot;Sylvia.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Wednesday night, she told guests at the Environmental Action Coalition's awards 
dinner in Manhattan what it had been like to recycle 25 years ago. 
&quot;I used to get on a bus when I was doing 'Butterflies Are Free' and take the 
garbage downtown to a recycling center,&quot; she said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">She recalled that she had involved her children Gwyneth Paltrow, the actress, 
and Jake Paltrow at a young age. 
&quot;In Los Angeles, Gwyneth used to hold up a sign at passing trucks from our car 
saying, 'You're polluting,' 
&quot; she said. 


Melville, Hawthorne and the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Crime writer Robert Graysmith, whose books include 
&quot;Zodiac&quot; and 
&quot;The Sleeping Lady,&quot; has been working on a book about the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> for the past two years. 
&quot;I'm always fascinated with manhunts,&quot; said the author, who used to be an editorial cartoonist. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Meanwhile, crime isn't 
Mr. Graysmith's only interest. He's just completed the manuscript of 
&quot;Melville's Romance,&quot; which he says describes Herman Melville's great passion for Nathaniel 
Hawthorne.
