</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> Pamela Burdman, Chronicle Staff Writer 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">It took federal agents only hours yesterday to confirm what they had feared: 
The bomb that killed a Sacramento lobbyist yesterday was the deadly work of the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> a mysterious killer who has eluded investigators for 17 years.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Sacramento bombing was the 16th known UNABOM incident and the eighth with a 
link to Northern California. Forestry Association President Gil Murray became 
the third victim killed by a lethal device. Twenty-two others have been 
injured. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The UNABOM name came because the bomber's early targets were universities and 
airlines. But like the December 9 death of New Jersey advertising executive 
Thomas J. Mosser, yesterday's bombing seems to shred investigators' earlier 
theories about the killer's motives.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''I've been scratching my head for the last couple hours since I heard about 
it,'' said Louis Bertram, a former FBI agent who started the first UNABOM task 
force in Salt Lake City eight years ago.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''We have looked everywhere from universities to computer stores to airlines,'' 
he said. ''This victim was a lobbyist. If it is the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> I'm sure a motive has occurred in his mind. But I just don't see it.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Investigators say they can quickly identify the perpetrator's work because of 
the attacker's habit of using homemade screws, 
polished wood and intricate wiring.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Because yesterday's target was a timber industry lobby group, investigators may 
re-examine earlier theories that the bomber has a fascination with trees or 
wood.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But agents were reluctant to give too much weight to that theory: ''I'm sure 
everybody's straining to make a connection of some kind,'' said John Brugger of 
the U.S. Postal Inspector's office in Washington, D.C.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Among the few links investigators have established is a connection to Northern 
California.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In July 1993, University of California at San Francisco genetics professor 
Charles Epstein and Yale University computer science theorist David Gelernter 
were both injured by bombs that listed California State University, Sacramento, 
return addresses.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In December, after Mosser was killed by a package bomb mailed in San Francisco, 
the 
FBI announced that a 30-agent federal task force was concentrating its 
investigation in Northern California because about half of the bombings had 
links to the area.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">They also posted a $ 1 million reward for information leading to the UNABOM 
killer and urged anyone with clues to call 1-800-701- BOMB.
