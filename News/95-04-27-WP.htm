Decries 'Techno-Nerds'

</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The serial bomber in the 
&quot;Unabom&quot; case appears to be motivated by a deep resentment of college graduates, 
scientists and advances in computer research, according to a letter made public 
yesterday. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">FBI officials in San Francisco released a letter, which they believe is from 
the bomber, that was sent last week to David Gelernter, a Yale University 
computer scientist who was severely injured by a package bomb in June 1993. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;People with advanced degrees aren't as smart as they think they are,&quot; the letter said. 
&quot;If you'd had any brains you would have realized that there are a lot of people 
out there who resent bitterly the way techno-nerds like you are changing the 
world and you wouldn't have been dumb enough to open an unexpected package from 
an unknown source.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The purported bomber, who has struck 16 times since 1978 and killed three 
people, continued: 
&quot;In the epilog of your book, 'Mirror Worlds,' you tried to justify your research 
by claiming that the developments you describe are inevitable, and that any 
college person can learn enough about computers to compete in a 
computer-dominated world. Apparently, people without a college degree don't 
count. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;In any case, being informed about computers won't enable anyone to prevent 
invasion of privacy (through computers), genetic engineering (to which 
computers make an important contribution), environmental degradation through 
excessive economic growth (computers make an important contribution to economic 
growth) and so forth. . . . 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;If the developments you describe are inevitable, they are not inevitable in the 
way that old age or bad weather are inevitable. They are inevitable only 
because 
techno-nerds like you make them inevitable. If there were no computer 
scientists there would be no progress in computer science. . . . But we do not 
believe that progress and growth are inevitable.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Jim Freeman, head of the FBI's San Francisco office, told reporters: 
&quot;This is the first time in 17 years we've had any degree of discussion by the 
<strong>Unabomber.</strong>&quot; He said the letter to Gelernter makes clear that his motivation is 
&quot;because the doctor is a computer scientist&quot; and the bomber 
&quot;vehemently objects&quot; to the direction of Gelernter's research. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Freeman said the FBI, which believes the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> is a white man in his early forties, has no evidence the killer is working 
with others. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Gelernter said yesterday that the FBI had asked him not to comment on the 
letter. He said that his book, 'Mirror Worlds,' sold fewer than 20,000 copies. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The letter to Gelernter is one of four, all postmarked Oakland, Calif., sent by 
the self-described 
&quot;anarchist&quot; last week. Two others went to individuals who have not been previous victims 
and whose names were not made public. The fourth was sent to the New York 
Times, which published it yesterday. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In that letter, which also indicated a desire to publicize his grievances, the 
writer demanded that a national newspaper or magazine publish a lengthy 
manuscript. The purported terrorist told the paper that 
&quot;we will permanently desist from terrorist activities&quot; if a manuscript of 29,000 to 37,000 words 
&quot;is published in the New York Times, Time or Newsweek, or in some other widely 
read, nationally distributed periodical. . . . Alternatively, it can be 
published as a small book. . . . If the answer is unsatisfactory, we will start 
building our next bomb.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The writer said that 
&quot;the article will not explicitly advocate violence. There will be an unavoidable 
implication that we favor violence to the extent that it may be 
necessary, since we advocate eliminating industrial society and we ourselves 
have been using violence to that end.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Times received the letter Monday, shortly before a package bomb killed 
Gilbert B. Murray, a timber industry official in Sacramento, Calif. It was 
postmarked Thursday, the day after the explosion in Oklahoma City. Some 
officials have speculated the bomber was seeking renewed attention in the wake 
of the Oklahoma City tragedy. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Times, which received a brief, similar letter two years ago, withheld 
certain identifying details at the FBI's request. One federal investigator said 
the letters showed the bomber was becoming more emotional and might be prone to 
make a mistake. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Robert K. Ressler, a 20-year FBI veteran who now runs a law enforcement 
consulting firm in Fredericksburg, 
Va., said the letters, if they are from the bomber, 
&quot;could be a basis for assessing his personality.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Ressler, who helped develop the FBI's methods for 
&quot;profiling&quot; -- creating a psychological and physical description of suspects -- said the 
letters show a man whose ego is driving him into the limelight. 
&quot;He's playing a dangerous game. He's now moved from anonymity to seeking great 
publicity in demands for getting this material published. . . . He wants public 
acknowledgment and social changes. He's setting rules that make him more 
important in his mind.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The writer's demand for space in a national publication poses a conflict 
between a news organization's natural instinct to maintain editorial control 
and its desire to cooperate with authorities. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Times quoted Publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. as saying that while the paper 
&quot;can't be held hostage by those who threaten violence . . . we'll take 
a careful look at it and make a journalistic decision about whether to publish 
it in our pages.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Robert J. Haiman, president of the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, said 
that 
&quot;this group, by its behavior so far, does not engender much confidence that 
they're honorable, trustworthy people. They're killers. I'm very nervous about 
newspapers making deals with killers.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">But Sanford J. Ungar, dean of American University's School of Communication, 
said that 
&quot;if 20,000 words might save lives and everyone knows why it's being printed, I 
think it's a pretty good deal.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">If his manuscript is published, the writer said, he would renounce terrorism (&quot;intended to cause injury or death to human beings&quot;) but not sabotage (&quot;intended to destroy property without injuring human beings&quot;). 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">News organizations have occasionally provided a 
forum for criminal suspects. During the 1993 siege of the Branch Davidians in 
Waco, Tex., radio stations across the state agreed to a government request to 
broadcast a 58-minute harangue by cult leader David Koresh.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In 1977, Jimmy Breslin, then a New York Daily News columnist, consulted with 
police before publishing a letter from the 
&quot;Son of Sam&quot; serial killer, David Berkowitz. Ressler said that Berkowitz, in a prison 
interview, said that 
&quot;when he saw his letters in the paper it really sent his ego out of control. 
Seeing these letters . . . probably escalated his murderous activities.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A year earlier, The Washington Post, New York Times, Chicago Tribune and Los 
Angeles Times published a statement by Croatian nationalists who had hijacked a 
Chicago-bound airplane and 
threatened to kill its 92 passengers. The hijackers later surrendered in Paris 
after receiving an ultimatum from authorities. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;We just didn't consider the possibility that we were being blackmailed,&quot; said Benjamin C. Bradlee, then The Post's executive editor and now a company 
vice president. 
&quot;None of us had the guts to read the story that said 'umpteen American hostages 
were killed today because Benjamin C. Bradlee refused to publish. . . .' 
&quot; Today, he said, 
&quot;my overwhelming feeling would be not to do it.&quot;
