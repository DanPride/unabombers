Cases tied to notorious serial bomber

</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A mail bomb exploded Thursday in the hands of a
world-renowned Yale University computer scientist in what federal
officials said was the second mail-bombing case this week that
could be linked to a serial bomber in operation since 1978.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The choice of targets in the Yale case and the Tuesday
bombing of a geneticist at the University of California at San
Francisco bears the hallmark of the elusive 
&quot;&quot;<strong>Unabom,</strong>'' who
targeted employees of the computer industry and university
researchers for more than a decade before the bombings stopped in
1987, officials said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has added the
Tuesday bombing that injured Charles Epstein to its 
<strong>Unabom</strong> incident
list, and FBI agents in New Haven, Conn., said there was an
&quot;&quot;unavoidable question of connection'' to Thursday morning's
bombing of David Gelernter at Yale University.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Named for a penchant for targeting academics, 
<strong>Unabom</strong> is
believed to be responsible for 12 bombings from 1978 to 1987 in
seven states that killed one person and injured 21.  Despite the
creation of a federal-state 
<strong>Unabom</strong> Task Force, which is still
active, the bomber's whereabouts and motives remain a mystery.  What
is known is the similarity of the victims, who have been university
scientists or employees in the computer and airline industries.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The New York Times reported that it received a letter
Thursday that warned of a 
&quot;&quot;newsworthy event'' and that law
enforcement officials said was signed by a bomber believed linked
to the earlier attacks.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The letter, postmarked June 21 from Sacramento, Calif.,
identifies its author as 
&quot;&quot;a group calling ourselves FC'' and
promises to 
&quot;&quot;give information about our goal at some future
time,'' the newspaper said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Gelernter, who created a computer language that allows
desktop computers to achieve the power of supercomputers, triggered
the explosion when he opened a package around 8:15 a.m. at the
school's computer center.  Gelernter suffered severe wounds to his
abdomen, chest, face and hands.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Across the country two days earlier, Epstein, known for his
work locating a gene that may contribute to Down's syndrome, opened
a package 
in the kitchen of his home in Tiburon, Calif., that had
arrived in mail brought in by his daughter Joanna, according to
Rick Smith, spokesman for the FBI's San Francisco bureau.  The
explosion blew off several of Epstein's fingers, broke his arm and
caused several abdominal injuries.  Epstein was listed in fair
condition following surgery.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>Unabom</strong> has never shied from targeting well-known people.  One of
his early targets, in June 1980, was Percy Wood, the president of
United Airlines, according to the ATF.  Among the 14 listed 
<strong>Unabom</strong>
incidents, at least six bombs were mailed and eight were put in
place by the suspect.  Federal officials said the San Francisco
package carried 
<strong>Unabom's</strong> signature: a pipe bomb in a small package
with explosions triggered by touch.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">FBI Director 
William Sessions warned university officials
Thursday to 
&quot;&quot;be alert to all packages and mail received'' at their
offices and homes.  In addition to this week's suspected 
<strong>Unabom</strong>
incidents, 
<strong>Unabom</strong> explosive devices have been found in the past at
Northwestern University, Vanderbilt University and the University
of Michigan.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Also targeted were Boeing Aircraft Co., Rentech Computer
Rental and United Airlines.  One mail bomb detonated on American
Airlines Flight 444 on Nov. 15, 1979, bound for Washington from
Chicago.  Twelve people suffered smoke inhalation.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
<strong>Unabom</strong> suspect disappeared following a Feb.20, 1987,
blast in Salt Lake City in which a witness was able to offer a
general description of a man who left a package that exploded in a
parking lot.  The white male was described as slender, 
5-foot-10 to
6 feet tall, 25 to 30 years old and with reddish-blond hair.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">ATF officials believe that the sighting may have forced him
underground.
