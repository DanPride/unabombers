</p><p class="subheader" align="left"><strong>HEADLINE:</strong> OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING;
RECKLESS BLAME-GAME 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">THE Clinton administration set the appropriate tone for the nation in the 
immediate aftermath of the horrific terrorist bombing in Oklahoma City when 
White House chief of staff Leon Panetta, asked to put a partisan spin on the 
motives of the bombers, said that 
&quot;legitimate political debate&quot; played no part in the senseless act.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">It went downhill from there.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">President Clinton, picking a familiar foe from his enemies' list, fingered talk 
radio for leaving the 
&quot;impression . . . that violence is acceptable.&quot; He went on to decry 
&quot;loud and angry voices in America today whose sole aim seems to be to try to 
keep some people as paranoid as possible and the rest of us all torn up and 
upset with each other.&quot; Political pundits joined in the blame-game with the contention that the new 
Republican Congress' anti-big government rhetoric somehow was responsible for 
the Oklahoma horror.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Ironically, on the the morning of the bombing, The Wall Street Journal 
published an editorial decrying the White House's use of 
&quot;extremist&quot; rhetoric in Washington's political debate. 
&quot;Not a day goes by,&quot; the Journal said, 
&quot;without some Clinton official using the word 'extremist' to describe something 
in Washington.&quot; The vice 
president, for instance, says opponents of both Surgeon General-nominee Henry 
Foster and funding for public television are extremists.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Congressional liberals have pushed the 
&quot;extreme&quot; button even further with wild claims that the GOP's budget-cutting policies 
are aimed at starving America's schoolchildren. Some have gone so far to equate 
budget cuts to a Hitleresque attack on the nation's poor.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">No one would suggest that such rhetoric, strident and, yes, extreme as it is, 
would prompt someone to buy bags of fertilizer, mix it with fuel oil and blow 
up the congressional offices of the Republican leadership any more than the 
protester outside the recent Goldwater Institute dinner here in Phoenix, 
brandishing a sign that said 
&quot;Nuke Newt,&quot; really meant to encourage bodily harm to Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The point, of course, is that one can be opposed to excessive 
government regulation and taxation, think that outlawing 
&quot;ugly looking&quot; rifles is a nonsensical policy and even be angry about how federal authorities 
handled the Waco cult and the tragic shooting of a Idaho separatist's wife and 
teen-age son during a standoff, and still deplore the horrible, violent act 
that killed so many innocent people in Oklahoma City.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mainstream conservatism is no more responsible for inciting such a despicable, 
cowardly act, than mainstream environmentalism can be blamed for the 
&quot;<strong>unabomber's&quot;</strong> killing of a timber industry lobbyist just days after the Oklahoma City 
tragedy. Talk radio's hosts and listeners are not to blame for the Oklahoma 
bombers' senseless acts any more than Hollywood, with its graphic portrayals of 
violence, and American moviegoers can be held accountable for the equally 
senseless homicidal slaughter 
on the streets of the nation's cities night after night.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">As The Washington Post put it, the partisan blame-game 
&quot;is not just unfair and off the mark; it also is a terrible idea. There has been 
practically no point in the turbulent national life of this country during the 
past three decades in which any side in the argument -- including this month's 
accusers -- could not itself have been accused by the loose rules of this game, 
of having either incited someone to a heinous act or provided the philosophical 
justification for his committing it.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A time of national tragedy is a time for calm and reverent reflection, a time 
to ponder what Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating has called 
&quot;the worst of humanity and the best of humanity,&quot; a time to even be angry at the perpetrators of such a horrific crime. 
Malicious and indiscriminate finger-pointing only points out the 
lack of character of those who engage in it.
