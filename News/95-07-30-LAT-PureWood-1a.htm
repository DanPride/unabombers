</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>DATELINE:</strong> SACRAMENTO 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Each day the tips flow in, a hundred of them, sometimes more.
They come from Sacramento, San Francisco and places far beyond -- from people
who believe they know the crafty serial bomber who has killed three people and
wounded 23 more. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Despite the extraordinary outpouring, authorities said last week that there is
no prime suspect in the 17-year-old Unabom case. But with the promise of a
$1.1-million reward for the killer's capture, there have been possibilities
galore. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
For a time, federal agents zeroed in on a suspicious sailor, only to learn he
was at sea during one of the bombings. On another occasion, a handyman in Salt
Lake City became a tantalizing target, but he too had an alibi. Authorities
also scrutinized a career criminal in Northern California, because his Social
Security number matches a code the bomber uses to <strong>identify</strong>
himself in letters. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
One &quot;potential suspect&quot; on the FBI's list is James William Kilgore,
48, a fugitive from justice who went underground on a bomb-related charge in
1976 and has not been seen since. Kilgore is best known for his connections to
the Symbionese Liberation Army -- the terrorist group that kidnaped newspaper
heiress Patricia Hearst more than two decades ago. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Some of those familiar with the Kilgore case see parallels with the <strong>Unabomber.</strong>
The height and general appearance are about right. So is the timing: the bomber
started mailing his deadly packages in 1978, not long after Kilgore
disappeared, vowing to attack the U.S. government. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
But the FBI has not pressed hard to find him, much to the frustration of some
critics of the Unabom probe: &quot;He is the only fugitive wanted for bombing
and hiding for 18 years -- and they can't find him?&quot; said one law enforcement
source. &quot;At least if they find him, they can find out whether he is the
guy.&quot; 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Officially, Kilgore remains &quot;a potential suspect, as much as anybody else
who hasn't been fully cleared, since he is still a fugitive,&quot; said the
FBI's Sacramento spokesman, Tom Griffin. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
The theory that Kilgore might be the <strong>Unabomber</strong> was
&quot;looked at with a fine-toothed comb,&quot; said one federal source.
&quot;Although he hasn't been totally eliminated, it doesn't strike any of (the
investigators) as a juicy thing.&quot; 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Those who knew Kilgore before he turned fugitive say he is an unlikely serial
killer. He is a nice guy among hard-edged radicals, they say, an idealist to
the core. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Since the <strong>Unabomber</strong> surfaced in the Midwest nearly two decades
ago, investigators have checked out hundreds of suspects. Because of his
targets, which have included airline executives and college professors, agents
have focused much of their energy on employees of airlines and universities, as
well as failed graduate students disgruntled because of thwarted ambitions. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
This year, when the bomber killed a Sacramento timber lobbyist and threatened
to blow up a plane at Los Angeles International Airport, agents received a
flurry of tips to a special, 24-hour hot line. Many calls have been wildly
improbable, fingering ex-husbands delinquent on child support payments and a
variety of apparently harmless eccentrics, including a hermit living in the
northern Sierra. 
<a name="UBID"></a></p><p class="body" align="Left">
Other calls have sparked visits by the FBI. Last month, two agents showed up at
the home of a former editor of the Berkeley Barb newspaper, saying they had a
tip that he was the <strong>Unabomber.</strong> And the operator of a
low-power, pirate radio station called Free Radio Berkeley was visited by an
agent with a similar accusation. Both men say the tips were unfounded and that
they know of other Bay Area activists who also have been questioned. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">

<a href="http://www.unabombers.com/GovernmentBehaviors.htm#NoSean">
In 1993, agents surmised that a seven-digit code used by the Unabomber as an
identifier in his letters to newspapers and others might be a Social Security
number. It was, belonging to a small-time career criminal who once lived in
Sacramento -- where agents believe the Unabomber may live.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Investigators became more intrigued when they discovered
that the convict bears a tattoo reading &quot;Purewoods&quot; on his arm. Wood
is a strong theme in the Unabomber's attacks, both in the components of his
devices and the names and addresses of his targets. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
But the criminal, whose record is dominated by theft and
other property crimes, was ruled out as a suspect because he was in prison at
the time of two bombings in 1993</a>. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Unlike many other potential suspects,
Kilgore presents special problems for investigators. He has been underground so
long that even onetime friends cannot describe his current appearance or
political beliefs. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
As with the <strong>Unabomber,</strong> his whereabouts are a mystery, which
means that agents cannot rule out his participation in the 16 attacks. And as
with the <strong>Unabomber,</strong> his occupation, lifestyle and habits are
all unknown. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Kilgore first surfaced in connection with the case in April, when KCBS-TV in
Los Angeles, citing unnamed federal sources, called him a &quot;prime
suspect&quot; in the Unabom attacks. FBI officials have repudiated the report,
but concede that Kilgore is one of many people they would like to interview. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Some law enforcement officials believe that Kilgore's background, coupled with
other factors, make him worth a careful look. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
&quot;I think he's interesting, and you certainly can't eliminate him,&quot;
said Lt. Joe Enloe, a Sacramento homicide detective involved in the investigation.
&quot;The <strong>Unabomber</strong> has been virtually invisible . . . all
these years, and you can say the same about Kilgore.&quot; 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Herbert Clough, the former agent-in-charge of the Los Angeles FBI office, said:
&quot;He meets a lot of the qualifications, in my view. He's real interesting
because of a number of . . . similarities.&quot; 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Among the reasons that Kilgore has attracted the attention of some law
enforcement officials: 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
* Photographs of Kilgore taken before he disappeared resemble a composite
sketch of the <strong>Unabomber,</strong> drawn after a lone <strong>witness</strong>
spotted someone leaving a bomb in a Salt Lake City parking lot in 1987. Like
the bomber, Kilgore is a white male with reddish hair now in his 40s. His build
-- 5 feet, 10 inches, 170 pounds -- matches the description of the <strong>Unabomber</strong>
as a man 5 feet, 10 inches, 160 pounds. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
* Kilgore is, in the words of one law enforcement source, &quot;a man of many
disguises,&quot; who easily obtained driver's licenses and other identification
in other names. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
* Born in Portland, Ore., he is the son of a former Marin County lumber broker,
which may be significant because of the wood theme running through the <strong>Unabomber's</strong>
attacks. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Some of the bomber's explosive devices have arrived in wooden boxes, while
others have had handcrafted wood parts. One of his targets was Percy Wood of
Lake Forest, Ill.; another lived on Aspen Drive. And his latest victim,
Sacramento lobbyist Gilbert Murray, worked for the California Forestry Assn.
until he was killed by a mail bomb in April. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
* Raised in Marin County, Kilgore knew the Bay Area intimately and also spent
time in Sacramento. Several of the <strong>Unabomber's</strong> packages and
letters have been mailed from Sacramento, and investigators believe he lives
there or in the Bay Area. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
* There are similarities between bombs planted by the Symbionese Liberation
Army in the 1970s and devices mailed by the <strong>Unabomber.</strong> Larry
Baggett, a former bomb squad expert for the Los Angeles Police Department, said
parallels include the use of wood components, the presence of nails as shrapnel,
the nature of the trigger mechanism, the use of batteries for ignition, and the
meticulous care used in the assembly of the devices. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
&quot;I'm not saying it's him, but there are definite similarities,&quot; said
Baggett, who dismantled two SLA bombs planted beneath LAPD vehicles in the
mid-1970s. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
* Kilgore is wanted on a charge of possessing an unregistered explosive device,
and FBI documents show that his fingerprints were found on a piece of
electrician's tape on a pipe bomb transported from an SLA hide-out. The
indictment alleges that Kilgore hired a man to move the bomb to another
location. He faces a maximum of 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine if
convicted. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
&quot;For many years, one of the individuals involved with the SLA . . . was
reputed to be the bomb expert for the SLA,&quot; said a source who is familiar
with the SLA prosecutions. &quot;That was Kilgore.&quot; 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
However, those who know him from the turbulent days of rebellion, arrest
warrants and eventual flight from the law say Kilgore does not fit the stereotype
of an anarchist bomber and is an improbable Unabom suspect. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Patricia Hearst, an SLA kidnap victim who later helped rob a bank, described
him in her book as a source of calm amid egocentric hotheads who made up the
terrorist clan. She called Kilgore, a onetime graduate student in economics at
UC Santa Barbara, &quot;the model of reason.&quot; 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Michael Bortin, once a close friend and house painting partner of Kilgore,
agreed. Among all those involved with the SLA, he said, &quot;Jim Kilgore
probably was the most levelheaded.&quot; 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Bortin, who says he and Kilgore were SLA supporters but not members, described
his old friend as an idealist, who once considered becoming a priest. Bortin,
now a floor refinisher in Portland, said he has not been in touch with Kilgore
since the 1970s, but has heard from friends that he now has a family. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
In 1990, Sacramento sheriff's detectives questioned Bortin in connection with
an April 21, 1975, bank robbery in the Sacramento suburb of Carmichael, in
which Myrna Opshal, a mother of four, was killed while making a deposit for her
church. According to FBI records, Hearst has alleged that Kilgore was in the
bank when another SLA member shot Opshal. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
&quot;I personally find it very offensive that this fine lady, Mrs. Opshal, was
killed and no one was ever tried for murder,&quot; said Sacramento Police Lt.
Harry Machen, who reopened the investigation in 1990 and presented his evidence
to a grand jury. &quot;I'm still hopeful. I'd like to talk to Kilgore or anyone
else who could help us make a case.&quot; 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
In addition to finding a Kilgore fingerprint on a pipe bomb, federal
authorities searching an SLA hide-out found several of his prints on a copy of
&quot;The Anarchist Cookbook,&quot; which describes how to construct pipe
bombs, time bombs and booby traps. It has sold 2 million copies since first
published in 1971. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Stuck between two pages of the book, FBI agents found a three-page, typewritten
document on building explosives and detonating devices. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Just before going underground, Kilgore and three other SLA associates issued a
&quot;communique&quot; vowing to continue the terrorist group's struggle: 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
&quot;We are proud to be among those fighting against the U.S. empire. We are
proud to have uncompromisingly supported people who have taken up arms against
the enemy. We will continue the struggle no matter what the personal
consequence may be.&quot;
