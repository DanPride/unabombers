</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">FBI crime laboratory experts gave inaccurate testimony at the trials of 
defendants in the World Trade Center blast and the 1989 bombing of Avianca 
Flight 203 in Colombia, and lab scientists and technicians used shoddy analysis 
and did not follow procedures in scores of other cases, the Justice 
Department's inspector general concluded Tuesday.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Those findings, coupled with serious problems in the way lab officials 
conducted themselves in the Oklahoma City bombing and the O.J. Simpson case, 
are part of a sweeping, 18-month investigation into significant failures at the 
lab at FBI headquarters in Washington.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The report could have major implications for the trial of Oklahoma City bombing 
suspect Timothy J. McVeigh because it tends to bolster defense arguments that 
lab work on key pieces of forensic evidence was compromised. But prosecutors 
plan to use scientific experts from outside the lab to testify.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In addition to conclusions about how lab officials have performed in court, the 
inspector general also found that the bureau's scientists and technicians did 
not properly document their test results and poorly prepared lab reports.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Reacting quickly to the report, senior FBI management officials accepted 
responsibility for the failings at their once-unblemished crime lab and also 
revealed that they have created a special task force to review 
&quot;hundreds&quot; of past and pending criminal cases that may have been impacted by faulty and 
sometimes shoddy FBI lab work.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">While top federal law enforcement officials expressed confidence that those and 
other cases will move forward, defense attorneys are expected to seize on the 
revelations in attempts to exonerate their clients.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In another development Tuesday, both Justice Department and FBI officials 
pointed out that the vast majority of the hundreds of allegations by the key 
whistle-blower, lab chemist and FBI agent Frederic Whitehurst were not 
substantiated.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Among the disproved allegations were Whitehurst's contentions that some lab 
examiners purposely shaded their results to help prosecutors, and that 
some of them knowingly committed perjury. But Inspector General Michael R. 
Bromwich added that 
&quot;some important&quot; allegations made by Whitehurst were substantiated, including some related to 
the Oklahoma City bombing case--in which jury selection is now underway for 
McVeigh's trial.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Overall, in investigating work at the lab's three key sections--the 
chemistry-toxicology, explosives and materials analysis units--Bromwich said: 
&quot;We found significant instances of testimonial errors, substandard analytical 
work and deficient practices.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Investigators also discovered instances where dictation on lab reports was 
altered and lab supervisors did not properly manage their agents.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">40 Recommendations to Improve Lab 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Bromwich and his staff, which included five prominent scientists from outside 
the federal government, listed 40 recommendations for improving the lab, and 
the FBI said it had either adopted or would soon be embracing 
all of them.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Among the key improvements will be a new lab facility at the bureau's training 
academy in Quantico, Va., a new lab director from outside the bureau and--for 
the first time in the lab's 65-year history--outside accreditation from the 
American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;This isn't a pleasant one for me,&quot; FBI Deputy Director William Esposito said of the inspector general's report. 
&quot;We regret we got to this point in the FBI.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">But Esposito noted that with the lab conducting tests on 600,000 cases a year, 
the vast majority of its work was not called into question.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Bromwich stressed Tuesday that his office was never charged with determining 
whether the criminal justice system was compromised by poor FBI lab work. But 
he predicted that 
&quot;there will be challenges&quot; filed by defense attorneys, either to overturn convictions or to 
throw out pieces of evidence.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;There are many cases that are potentially implicated by the findings,&quot; he said. 
&quot;We expect to see a lot of motions filed.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">James M. Maddock, the FBI's inspector deputy general counsel, said the bureau 
has established a special team to investigate potential problems, and that it 
is now reviewing 
&quot;several hundred&quot; past cases.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Potential Problems Cited in 55 Cases 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Meanwhile, prosecutors in about 55 pending criminal cases have been notified 
that there may be potential problems, he said.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In those 55, prosecutors have found it important enough to notify defense 
attorneys in about 25 cases. Of those, there have since been verdicts for the 
prosecution in 14, Maddock said, and motions for new trials have been denied.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Regarding the rest, he said, 
&quot;we are confident we can work with the prosecutors to resolve these issues.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Bromwich's report does not say when or why the 
problems began at the lab, but some of the cases studied date back to the 
1980s. As early as 1991, top FBI management was alerted to failures at the lab 
when it used a highly credited model designed by the ASCLD to 
<strong>identify</strong> deficiencies.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Among the cases reviewed by the inspector general: 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">* The Oklahoma City bombing.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building was destroyed on April 19, 1995, killing 
168 people and injuring 500 others.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The inspector general said that the FBI lab's David Williams 
&quot;repeatedly&quot; reached conclusions that were in error.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In addition, the explosives unit chief, J. Thomas Thurman, 
&quot;performed an inadequate review of Williams' report by allowing Williams too 
much discretion and by approving conclusions with which Thurman disagreed and 
could not support.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The report also concluded that Roger Martz, chief of the lab's 
chemistry-toxicology unit, 
&quot;improperly deviated from the explosives residue protocol in his examination of 
some specimens.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Additionally, the inspector general concluded that Williams was unjustified in 
his opinion about the speed of the bomb, incomplete in his statements about the 
use of ammonium nitrate and inappropriate in his identification of the main 
detonation charge.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;These errors were all tilted in such a way as to incriminate the defendants,&quot; the inspector general's report said.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;We are troubled that the opinions in Williams' report may have been tailored to 
conform to the evidence associated with the defendants. We conclude that 
Williams failed to present an objective, unbiased, competent report.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI objected to any conclusion that Williams' opinions were 
pro-prosecution. As to Thurman, the FBI noted his 27-year FBI career and said 
he has only 
&quot;committed a few minor mistakes and one significant managerial error in 
approving Williams' report on the Oklahoma 
City bombing.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bureau also took exception to the assertion that Martz 
&quot;lacks the credibility, judgment and temperament that is essential for a unit 
chief.&quot; Such a statement, the FBI said, 
&quot;seems to be an overly broad condemnation.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">* The World Trade Center explosion of Feb. 26, 1993, which killed six people.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Much of the forensic evidence from the blast--particularly as it pertained to 
the chief defendant, Mohammed A. Salameh--was examined by Williams in the lab's 
explosives unit. The militant Muslim was found guilty in 1994 of conspiring to 
bomb the trade center.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">But, the inspector general concluded, 
&quot;we are profoundly disturbed by Williams' testimony in the Salameh trial.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Specifically, Williams 
&quot;gave inaccurate testimony regarding Salameh's role in the manufacture of urea 
nitrate and regarding whether the urea nitrate was made pursuant to Arabic 
formulas from bomb-making books.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Williams testified 
&quot;beyond his expertise&quot; and 
&quot;in a way that made the testimony appear tailored to the most incriminating 
result,&quot; investigators concluded.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">And, the inspector general said, Williams gave incomplete testimony about the 
velocity of the bomb and invalid and misleading opinions about other details.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI, in its official response to the inspector general's findings, objected 
to suggestions that Williams' testimony appeared to be pro-prosecution. 
&quot;Williams' testimony on cross-examination was proper, and none of the 
inaccuracies criticized by the inspector general were significant in the jury's 
determination of guilt,&quot; the FBI said.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">But Robert Precht, who was Salameh's defense attorney, noted that since the FBI 
has known for at least six years of problems at the lab, 
&quot;this provides powerful ground for arguing for a new trial.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;It's possible the FBI withheld important exculpatory evidence from the defense 
due to these 
problems in the lab,&quot; Precht said. 
&quot;And certainly if I had known of these allegations, I would have pursued my 
cross-examination of FBI 
<strong>witnesses</strong> in different ways.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">* The Avianca airplane bombing.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">One hundred seven people, including two Americans, died when a bomb exploded 
aboard Avianca Flight 203 shortly after takeoff on Feb. 27, 1989, from Bogota, 
Colombia.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Richard Hahn, a lab expert, was assigned to the case as part of a U.S.  team. 
He testified as an explosives expert in two trials of Dandeny Munoz-Mascara in 
New York. The first ended in a mistrial, the second in conviction.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The inspector general concluded that Hahn committed several errors.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;He erroneously testified in the first trial that no dynamite could have caused 
the pitting and cratering on the aircraft,&quot; the inspector general said.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
report said Hahn gave expert scientific opinions about the blast that were 
&quot;unsound and not justified by his experience&quot; and 
&quot;incomplete results&quot; about some of the lab analyses of the evidence, and that he 
&quot;testified incorrectly and outside his expertise concerning a fuel-air explosion.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The lead prosecutor in the case defended Hahn to the inspector general, saying 
that he was being 
&quot;unfairly attacked.&quot; And the FBI, in its response, urged unsuccessfully that any suggestion that 
Hahn was trying to support the prosecution's theory of the case should be 
&quot;deleted&quot; from the final report.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">* The George Bush assassination plot.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In April 1993, while former President Bush was visiting Kuwait, authorities 
there arrested 17 people allegedly involved in a plot to kill him using a car 
bomb. The United States retaliated with a missile strike to Iraq, and a Kuwaiti 
court convicted all but one of the defendants.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Whitehurst alleged that J. Christopher Ronay, the explosives unit chief, 
changed or misrepresented Whitehurst's lab results--a charge that the inspector 
general discounted. Instead, the inspector general faulted Whitehurst for the 
way he prepared his chemical analysis reports.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Since Bromwich began his investigation, Williams, Thurman and Martz have been 
transferred out of the lab. Whitehurst also was moved aside.  The FBI said it 
was leaving it to the Justice Department to advise about Whitehurst's future.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">On Capitol Hill, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), who chairs a Senate 
subcommittee on oversight of federal law enforcement, was outraged about how 
the FBI has conducted itself.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;It seems the FBI chose to protect its image rather than improve its product,&quot; he said. 
&quot;The moral of this story is senior management at the FBI abdicated its 
responsibility to the American people and more importantly to 
thousands of honest, hard-working FBI agents around the country.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Times staff writer Sam Fulwood contributed to this story.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Lab Results 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Principal findings by investigators in the FBI laboratory case: 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">* Scientifically flawed testimony in four cases, including the World Trade 
Center bombing.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">* Inaccurate testimony by an explosives unit examiner from the lab in the World 
Trade Center case 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">* Testimony beyond the examiner's expertise in the World Trade Center and the 
1989 explosion of Avianca Airlines flight 203, in which 107 people on board 
were killed.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">* Insufficient documentation of test results in hundreds of cases, including 
the hunt for the 
<strong>Unabomber.</strong>  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">* Failures by management to properly supervise lab examiners and their test 
results.
