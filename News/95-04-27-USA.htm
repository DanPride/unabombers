</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In an era of terrorist bombings, those behind the Oklahoma City blast proved 
the deadliest - but experts call the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> the most proficient.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">No one in the United States has set off as many bombs (16) over as long a 
period (17 years) as the self-described 
&quot;anti-industrial anarchist&quot; who spelled out his motives this week.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">And few criminals drop so many intriguing clues, ranging from a penchant for 
wood and wood puns to a series of highly literate, possibly coded letters.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The task force that has chased the bomber since 1982 hopes a new crop of 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> letters will produce a breakthrough. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;He now thinks he is untouchable in his own belief system,&quot; an investigator told The Associated Press.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Federal authorities Wednesday released the text of one letter, sent to Yale 
University computer science professor David Gelernter, who was badly injured by 
a Unabom mail package he opened in June 1993.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The communique, along with a letter to The New York Times, was mailed from 
Oakland at the same time as the mail bomb that on Monday killed California 
Forestry Association lobbyist Gilbert Murray, authorities said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the letter, 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> denounced Gelernter as a 
&quot;techno-nerd&quot; and criticized his book, Mirror Worlds, which predicts the rise of computers. 
He taunted Gelernter for getting injured.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;If you'd had any brains . . . you wouldn't have been dumb enough to open an 
unexpected package from an unknown source,&quot; the letter read. The bomber 
listed FBI headquarters as his return address.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In The Times letter, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> said he belonged to an anarchist cell, 
&quot;FC,&quot; bent on destroying 
&quot;the worldwide industrial system.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The people who are pushing all this growth and progress garbage deserve to be 
severely punished,&quot; the letter said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Despite his use of the word 
&quot;we&quot; in describing his exploits, federal authorities still believe the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> is a white male loner in his 40s.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;We feel the strategy we launched after the June 1993 bombings has been right on,&quot; FBI Special Agent-in-Charge Jim Freeman said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Another 100 FBI agents have been brought in to chase down leads, Freeman said. 
More than 600 calls poured into the Unabom hot line Tuesday, he added.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;If he didn't have an extraordinary degree of criminal savoir-faire, he would 
have gotten caught years ago,&quot; said James 
Fox of Northeastern University criminal justice school.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Starting in 1978, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> sent bombs to science and engineering professors at universities as well as to 
airlines. Thinking they had a disgruntled student or airline employee on their 
hands, the FBI code-named the investigation Unabom.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A 1980 bombing in Lake Forest, Ill., of United Airlines President Percy Wood 
sustained the airline theme. It also opened up a new one - picking victims with 
references to 
&quot;wood,&quot; in names or addresses.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Later, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> attacked a man who lived on Aspen Drive and used phony return addresses 
including Ravenswood and Forest Glen Road. One bomb was in a book with a leaf 
embossed on the cover; another was adorned with twigs.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Wood bombing also brought the first of the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> letters, said psycholinguist 
Murray Miron, who has studied his writings. The letter was signed Enoch W. 
Fischer. Miron said he thinks he may have been likening himself to a Biblical 
figure named Enoch, who acted in the role of an invisible avenger.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Six more bombs of increasing intensity hit university and airline targets from 
Nashville to Berkeley, Calif., between 1981 to 1985.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Miron said the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> sent a letter to one of the professors claiming to be a student who planned to 
send his dissertation for review.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A Dec. 11, 1985, bomb killed a computer store owner, giving detectives another 
tack: Perhaps the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> was a modern-day Luddite, railing against high technology.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Next, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> left a package outside a Salt Lake City computer store on Feb. 20, 1987 - 
but he was seen by a passerby. Out went a composite picture of a ruddy-faced 
white male with strawberry blonde hair under a sweatshirt hood.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> went underground for six years.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">When he re-emerged, starting with a package bomb to a northern California 
professor in June 1993, he had shifted exclusively to mail bombs.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Last December came the fatal attack on New Jersey advertising executive Thomas 
Mosser.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The New York Times received a letter from Sacramento postmarked before that 
bombing. Like the one received this week by the paper, it was signed 
&quot;FC&quot; and included a nine-digit number that could be used to authenticate future 
communications.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">What seemed a promising clue emerged from the letter. Investigators traced the 
impression of a message the bomber might have written on 
an overlapping slip of paper: 
&quot;Call Nathan R Wed 7 p.m.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">They checked 10,000 names before deciding the message was written by somebody 
else on a library typewriter - another dead end.
