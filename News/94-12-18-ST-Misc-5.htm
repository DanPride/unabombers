</p><p class="body" align="Left">The long talked-about City of Seattle Public Access Network (PAN) has come out 
with its first public release, and you can travel several roads to get to it.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Right now, the content is divided by categories such as arts, community, 
education, employment, environment, government and transportation, but PAN 
plans to fine-tune it using feedback from the public.  

 Most impressive is PAN's ability to search for keywords from any menu. And its 
jobs section is promising, allowing one to search by job title or minimum 
salary.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">PAN also lets you choose between plain text and a point-and-click version that 
uses icons as menu options. The latter requires RIPTerm, a software developed 
for electronic bulletin boards, on your hard drive. The software is available 
free via PAN and many Internet and BBS sites.
 PAN expects to have a public site on the World Wide Web by early next year, 
and that should provide a much more elegant visual presentation than RIPTerm.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">How to get there:
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Direct modem dial: 233-7100
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Internet: telnet
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> pan.ci.seattle.wa.us
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Library gateways: King County (382-2116) and Seattle Public (386-4142).
</p><p class="body" align="Left">For voice help using PAN: 386-1200.
 Just ask Bill (Gates). On Jan. 3, Microsoft's mogul starts a twice-a-month 
column in newspapers nationwide. He's even got the time (or is it a hired 
hand?) to answer questions from readers on any computing subject. The address:

 Snow business. The Husky Winter Sports Ski School has created a World Wide Web 
site that allows online registration and links to skiing and snowboarding 
newsgroups. It's at:
</p><p class="body" align="Left">http://weber.u.washington.edu/finch/HWShome.html (no hyphens)

 The UW site also links to the Cascade Ski Report, hosted by Issaquah-based 
Internet Service Company. The site provides snow levels and weekday weather 
forecasts by UW meteorologist 
Jim Steenburg. You can also get there directly:
</p><p class="body" align="Left">http://www.net-serve.com/ski-report.html (hyphens only after net and ski)
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Site developer Jim Bachesta eventually plans to add pictures of the ski slopes 
and the runs currently open.
 And even if you don't have a visual 
&quot;browser&quot; like Mosaic to get the full flavor of the Web, your Internet provider probably 
has lynx, which provides text-only access. Try typing lynx at your command line 
and the return key.
For those limited to e-mail, reports are available via:
listserver@net-serve.com
In the message itself type:
 get ski-report index
 Seattle Sounders. Claiming to be the first soccer club to have its own Web 
page, the Seattle Sounders have gone online with team stats, a group picture 
and links to U.S. and foreign 
soccer sites. It's at:

 FBI tracking bomber. It's been out there a while, but worth a reminder even 
though it hasn't been updated since November: The FBI's Internet site with 
background on the 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> bombings.

 New sound waves. The Seattle Times two Sundays ago ran a story on 
&quot;ambient&quot; music and its online origins. There's a central gopher archive on the Internet 
(includes information on another phenomenon, raves) at:
