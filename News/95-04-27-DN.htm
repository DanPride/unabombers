</p><p class="subheader" align="left"><strong>HEADLINE:</strong> WEIRD CALL - AND THEN UNABOMB 



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> By AL BAKER in Sacramento, Calif. and LAURIE C. MERRILL in New York 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong> 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A caller professing to be the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> left a bizarre voice message at a Sacramento office hours before his latest 
mail bomb killed a timber industry lobbyist. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Hi. I'm the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> and I just called to say hi,&quot; the caller said in a deep, gravelly voice on a secretary's line at the 
Association of California Insurance Companies.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Reports of the odd message came as the FBI released a taunting letter the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> sent to the Yale University computer science professor he severely injured in 
a June 1993 bombing. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">It also came the day The New York Times published a letter described by the FBI 
as an 
&quot;extortion demand&quot; in which the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> threatens to build more bombs unless a book-length article he is writing is 
published by a major periodical. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The odd phone message FBI agents were not convinced it was really from the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> because it would be the first he'd left was called in Sunday and heard by a 
secretary Monday at the insurance building. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">If it was the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> speculated insurance association spokesman Bill Packer, he may have misdialed. 
The Sacramento County sheriff's office phone number is one digit from the 
secretary's. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In his letter to 
Yale Prof. David Gelernter, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> who has killed three and injured 23 in a 17-year reign of terror seems clearly 
resentful of Gelernter's advanced degree. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;People with advanced degrees aren't as smart as they think,&quot; the letter said. 
&quot;If you had any brains you would have realized that there are a lot of people 
out there who resent bitterly the way techno-nerds like you are changing the 
world, and you wouldn't have been dumb enough to open an unexpected package 
from an unknown source.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The letter was one of four sent from Oakland, Calif., on Thursday, the day 
after the Oklahoma City blast. One went to The Times and two to people 
unconnected to the probe, FBI agents said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The latest bomb, the most powerful to date, also was mailed Thursday from 
Oakland. The return address on the Gelernter letter was FBI headquarters, 
Washington. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">He challenges Gelernter's book, 
&quot;Mirror World&quot;: 
&quot;You 
tried to justify your research by claiming that the developments you describe 
are inevitable, and that any college person can learn about about computers to 
compete in a computer-dominated world. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Apparently, people without a college degree don't count.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">His letter to The Times makes note of computer experts, saying: 
&quot;The people we are out to get are the scientists and engineers, especially in 
critical fields like computers and genetics.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bomber also threatens in the letter to keep mailing bombs unless The Times 
or Newsweek or Time magazines publish a 37,000-word article he says he is 
writing. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;If the answer is unsatisfactory, we will start building our next bomb,&quot; he writes.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The ball is in the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> court in terms of reaching out to The New York Times,&quot; said Jim Freeman, agent in charge of the Unabom task force. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> signed both 
letters FC, ostensibly after an anarchist group. But FBI officials said he is 
acting alone. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">FBI agents also were checking reports that the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> conducted test blasts in the Sierra desert.
