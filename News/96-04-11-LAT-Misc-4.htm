<strong>UNABOMBER</strong>

</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong> 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Federal investigators searching the mountainside shack of Theodore J. Kaczynski 
have discovered a hooded sweatshirt and aviator sunglasses that closely 
resemble those reportedly worn by the elusive 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> the one time he is believed to have been sighted while placing a bomb. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The glasses and sweatshirt were a prominent feature of a sketch of the 
suspected 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> that has been circulated since February 1987, when a worker at a Salt Lake 
City computer store reported that she saw a man with a mustache, dark glasses 
and a sweatshirt put something under the wheel of her car in the store's 
parking lot. The parcel exploded when another worker moved the item. The woman 
is believed by authorities to be the only person to see the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> planting a bomb. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Officials also disclosed that lists found in Kaczynski's cabin included names 
of at least three prominent 
timber association executives from the Northwest. Government officials have 
told the executives to 
&quot;keep their eyes open and be careful&quot; on the off chance that a bomb might already have been planted, industry 
officials said.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The last of the three people killed by Unabom attacks was Gilbert Murray, 
president of the California Forestry Assn., who died in an explosion at the 
group's headquarters in Sacramento just under a year ago. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Those disclosures came as the government, for the first time, officially tied 
Kaczynski to the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> full spree of crimes. Kaczynski has been charged with a single count of 
possessing bomb-making materials, and until now the government has only 
unofficially linked him to the 16 bombings. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">But in a court proceeding Wednesday, opposing a request by news organization to 
release documents in the case, government lawyers confirmed Kaczynski's status 
as a suspect in all the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> crimes. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In arguing that the documents should remain secret, Assistant U.S. Atty. 
Bernard F. Hubley said government officials had promised the 
Kaczynski family that further information about the family would be kept 
confidential in exchange for their cooperation. District Judge Charles C. 
Lovell ruled that the promise should outweigh the public's right to immediate 
information in a case, which has riveted worldwide attention to western Montana 
since Kaczynski's arrest last week. Lovell said he would consider releasing the 
information next week. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI's application justifying the search warrant for Kaczynski's cabin was 
sought by news organizations, including the Los Angeles Times. The government 
objected to releasing the information, which 
&quot;describes a series of crimes occurring over an 18-year period, including 16 
bombings and three murders.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The FBI's overt investigation of Kaczynski's ties to specific bombing incidents 
is only a few weeks old, and an extraordinary amount of work remains to be done,&quot; Hubley argued 
in court filings. The media's 
&quot;contention that the government's investigation is 'essentially complete' simply 
ignores the reality of this case.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Lovell also extended until Monday the period in which federal agents can search 
Kaczynski's mountain shack. The search warrant had been scheduled to expire 
next Saturday. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;There were explosive devices and components which have necessitated cautious 
examination by X-ray equipment at the place to be searched,&quot; Lovell said in court. 
&quot;The presence of these devices caused some delay in the exercise of the warrant 
and the completion of the search.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Meantime, sources familiar with the investigation said that agents had 
recovered at least one manual typewriter from Kaczynski's cabin in addition to 
the two typewriters whose discovery has already been reported. It could not be 
learned, however, whether any of the machines have been identified as the 
typewriter used for the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> 35,000-word manifesto, letters to newspapers and other writing recovered from 
bomb scenes. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Last week, government sources said there had been a preliminary match between 
one of two machines found at Kaczynski's cabin and the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> writing, but that additional testing at the FBI laboratory in Washington was 
needed. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">At the time, those officials estimated the testing would take two to three 
days, but now they decline to say whether any of the machines match or have 
been ruled out. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The sources also revealed further signs of Kaczynski's estrangement from his 
family, particularly his father, who died in 1990. According to the sources, 
the suspect had told his family to use a special code when they were writing 
him about something 
&quot;urgent and important.&quot; He instructed them to underline in red the postage stamp on any such 
correspondence to assure he would not ignore it. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The sources, confirming an account first reported by the Chicago Tribune, said 
that the family used the urgent red line when they 
wrote him of his father's death. Kaczynski objected to that use of the code, 
saying the death of his father did not warrant it. As previously reported, 
Kaczynski did not attend his father's funeral. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In arguing for public release of the file on the search warrant, attorney John 
Morrison, representing the news organizations, said that 
&quot;the story of Theodore Kaczynski is on the lips of thousands of Americans.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The public already knows that the government believes Mr. Kaczynski engaged in 
criminal activity,&quot; Morrison said. Without accurate information about the case from the news 
media, 
&quot;more and more people will make up their minds and get their opinions based upon 
what is insufficient evidence.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">But Lovell, citing the risk that evidence would be lost and 
<strong>witnesses</strong> influenced, denied the request. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In addition to a comprehensive statement of the government's evidence, the file 
would include information about leads explored and as-yet 
untapped and a list of 
<strong>witnesses</strong> and potential 
<strong>witnesses.</strong> The affidavit also includes portions of Kaczynski's letters to his family and 
other confidential information from his relatives. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;In order to obtain the cooperation of the Kaczynski family, the government 
agreed to protect the letters from public disclosure to the extent possible,&quot; Hubley said in opposing release of the papers. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The search warrant affidavit includes 
&quot;a substantial amount of information received from members of Kaczynski's family,&quot; underscoring just how crucial the family's cooperation has been and just how 
much the prosecution wants to protect its relationship with them. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Unsealing the affidavit now, at 
&quot;this highly sensitive stage of the investigation,&quot; Hubley said in the documents, 
&quot;will significantly damage the investigation.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In support of their argument, government lawyers provided an affidavit from FBI 
officials citing problems that have occurred with some potential 
<strong>witnesses</strong> because of publicity in the case. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In particular, the government pointed to the 
manager of a Sacramento hotel as proof of how media attention can taint a case 
and create 
&quot;false positives&quot; in 
<strong>witness</strong> identification. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Government officials did not name the manager in question, but said that over 
the past several weeks, the FBI had interviewed him and that he had been unable 
to 
<strong>identify</strong> a photograph. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Since Kaczynski's arrest, however, several newspapers and television stations 
have interviewed the man and quoted him as saying that Kaczynski had stayed at 
the hotel several times in years past. Such an identification puts Kaczynski in 
Sacramento, where several of the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> lethal packages were mailed. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The FBI has again interviewed this individual, who has advised that the media 
had misquoted him and that he thought Mr. Kaczynski had been seen in the area 
of the hotel,&quot; the federal affidavit said. 
&quot;He had no records to support this, and told the FBI he had no records of hotel 
stays.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Also on Wednesday, Lovell denied a 
request from Kaczynski's attorney for an inventory of all evidence and property 
seized. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">La Ganga reported from Helena and Ostrow from Washington. Times staff writers 
John Balzar in Helena, Paul Jacobs in Sacramento, Amy Wallace in Los Angeles, 
Judy Pasternak in Chicago, and Richard Paddock in Mendocino, Calif., 
contributed to this story.
