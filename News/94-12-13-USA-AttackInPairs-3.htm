</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bomb that killed a New Jersey advertising executive was mailed from San 
Francisco, the FBI said Monday.<a name="Pairs"></a>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">And the bomber may be poised to strike again.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"><a href="http://www.Unabombers.com/#Pairs">The FBI notes two attacks in 1993 - and others in 1982 and 1985 - came in 
pairs, suggesting a pattern. </a>  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The bomber knows to get attention he has to start killing people,&quot; says Lawrence Myer, who is writing a book on serial bombers. 
&quot;He will not stop.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Officials warn people not to open unexpected packages and to contact police 
about any suspicious parcels.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The latest bomb is believed the handiwork of the 
&quot;<strong>Unabom&quot;</strong> case suspect, an elusive killer believed responsible for 14 other explosions 
since 1978.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bomber's toll: two dead and 23 injured. Saturday's bomb killed Young 
&amp; Rubicam's Thomas Mosser, 50.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The blast was the first linked to the 
<strong>Unabom</strong> case in 18 months. The videotape-size package that exploded at Mosser's home 
in North Caldwell, N.J., included a return address and was postmarked Dec. 3.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The (bomb) components, its construction, make us believe the bombs are linked,&quot; says 
FBI agent Barry Mawn.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The letters 
&quot;FC&quot; have been on fragments of up to 11 bombs. A letter last year to The New York 
Times said 
&quot;FC&quot; is an anarchist group. It also may be an anti-computer phrase.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mosser was the fourth bomb target to get prior mention in the Times involving 
high-tech fields. His firm was recently hired by computer giants Xerox and 
Digital Equipment.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The latest mail explosion, during the holiday season, sent jitters nationwide.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In Meriden, Conn., postal workers called police to check a ticking parcel. It 
turned out to be an answering machine.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Still, experts urge caution.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Unless they know where a package has come from and they know the person who 
sent it, they should call that person to verify,&quot; says Thomas Brodie, author of Bombs 
&amp; Bombings: 
A Handbook to Detection.
