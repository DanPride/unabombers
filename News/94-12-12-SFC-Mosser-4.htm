 Deadly package mailed to New Jersey ad man 



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> Catherine Bowman, Michael Taylor, Chronicle Staff 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The mysterious mail bomb that killed an advertising executive in New Jersey 
over the weekend has been linked to 
<strong>UNABOM,</strong> a nationwide series of bombings that has killed a computer expert and injured 
22 other people over the past 16 years, the FBI said yesterday.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Showing its frustration at not being able to catch the bomb maker, who has 
never been identified, the FBI urged the public to rack its collective brain 
for any hint or recollection of anything that might help federal agents crack 
the case.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''Progress is essential in this case because there is great concern the bomber 
or bombers will strike again,'' Jim Freeman, the FBI's top agent in San 
Francisco, said yesterday. ''We believe there is someone who may know or 
suspect the identity of the bomber or bombers. Such information is needed to 
prevent more persons from being killed and maimed.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The number to call, with anonymity guaranteed, Freeman said, is (800) 701-BOMB 
-- (800) 701-2662. The FBI also said it is releasing an ''enhanced sketch,'' 
based upon the description by an eyewitness who saw the suspect placing a bomb 
near a computer company's building in Utah seven years ago.  The sketch was 
drawn by Jeanne Boylan, who helped investigators in the Polly Klaas kidnapping 
case.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Freeman said a previous sketch that was drawn seven years ago by another artist 
brought many leads, but none of them panned out.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''We just hope this might be of added assistance,'' he said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The federal task force looking into 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> is headquartered in San Francisco because at least five of the incidents have 
been linked to Northern California.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">FBI agents acknowledged that it has been difficult to 
find a connection between the bombings, which have occurred all over the 
country and whose victims have included university professors, computer store 
employees and airline passengers. About half the bombs were letter or package 
bombs sent to individuals, Freeman said, and the others were placed in 
locations where someone would disturb them.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''In those instances, you can't say the (suspect) was targeting a particular 
individual,'' Freeman said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Death in New Jersey
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI's unusual display of apparent desperation came after the death Saturday 
of Thomas J. Mosser, 50, in North Caldwell, N.J. Mosser was killed in his 
kitchen when he opened a small package that had been addressed to him and 
delivered by the U.S. Postal Service the day before. The package was about the 
size of a standard videotape cassette.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mosser was promoted less than two weeks ago to general manager and executive 
vice president of 
Young 
&amp; Rubicam, one of the world's biggest advertising agencies. His wife, Susan, and 
his two children -- one 13 years old and the other 15 months old -- were at 
home when the bomb exploded. None of them was injured.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Neither federal and local officials nor senior executives for Young 
&amp; Rubicam could offer an explanation for the attack on Mosser.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''We really have no knowledge of this crime,'' Young 
&amp; Rubicam senior vice president Richard McGowan said in a telephone interview. 
''We're cooperating with the FBI and other authorities investigating the case. 
Tom was a close friend of many of us and an absolute professional at his work, 
and we are simply stunned by this senseless loss.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In San Francisco, Freeman said experts are ''saying, without question, that the 
same individual that's been responsible for the other 
<strong>UNABOMs</strong> mailed this device. There's enough evidence . . . to lead us to 
believe it's the same individual involved.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Characteristic Evidence
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Although the FBI was tight-lipped about how it had linked Mosser's death to the 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> investigation, Freeman said explosives experts who have sifted through the 
bomb debris in Mosser's home ''recognized certain unique evidence components as 
belonging to the 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> series.'' In the past, investigators have said the bombs are fashioned from 
common and easily obtainable items, such as nails, but contain handmade 
switches and pieces of wood that have been highly polished.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Freeman would not divulge what evidence was found, nor would he say from where 
the bomb was mailed. He said investigators still believe that the bombs are the 
work of a single suspect but have not ruled out the possibility that others may 
have assisted.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI has developed a profile of the suspect. Agents believe that he is a 
white male in his late 30s or 40s, with a high school 
education and a familiarity with college environments as well as knowledge of 
the Bay Area and the other places where bombs have been mailed or planted.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Freeman said the suspect is ''probably a loner'' and is ''very meticulous'' in 
the way he constructs the bombs.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''He might even appear to be a very nice guy with no predisposition to 
violence,'' he said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">4 Geographic Regions
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> incidents -- most were bombs that went off, two were disarmed -- have been 
centered in the Chicago area, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Northern California. 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> (a contraction of ''university,'' ''airline'' and ''bomb'') got its name from 
the first series of bombings: The first two bombs were aimed at universities; 
the second two, airlines.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">What makes solving the bombings so difficult for investigators is that they 
have few common links. So far, the only clues have been a brief sighting of the 
suspect in Salt Lake City in 1987 and a letter to the 
New York Times last year, in which the bomber said a group known as ''FC'' was 
responsible for two bombings in June 1993. One of those bombs injured a 
professor at the University of California at San Francisco in his Tiburon home; 
the other, a Yale University professor in his office.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''You keep chewing on the same thing, hoping to go further,'' U.S. Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms spokesman John Killorin said last year, after the 
two June bombings, ''but it's just not there.'' Killorin's agency, along with 
the U.S. Postal Service, is working with the FBI on the 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> case. A reward of $ 1 million has been posted.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In a backhanded compliment, the FBI's top explosives expert, Christopher Ronay, 
said the maker of the 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> devices is ''creative because almost every 
one of the bombs has been crafted in a unique way, so much so that to the 
untrained eye, they may not be related. And he's elusive because he's picked 
his targets in a way in which we can't find a common element.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">COMMON ELEMENTS
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Until Saturday, however, there were the common elements of computer experts, 
universities and airlines.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Of the 15 incidents since May 25, 1978, nine had something to do with 
universities or their professors. In the two incidents involving airlines, one 
was a bomb aboard an American Airlines jet in 1979 and the other was a mail 
bomb that injured the president of United Airlines at his home in 1980.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Another incident involved a bomb mailed to the Boeing Co. in Auburn, Wash., 
from Oakland. In that incident, the bomb was disarmed.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the mid-1980s, the 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> terrorist went after computer experts. In 
1985, a computer store owner in Sacramento was killed when he tried to move a 
package left near his store, and in 1987, a Salt Lake City computer sales and 
service employee was injured when he, too, tried to move a package near the 
firm's building.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Another coincidence that has been explored by investigators is the possibility 
that the bomber was picking his targets from newspaper articles.  After the 
June 1993 bombings of UCSF Professor Charles Epstein and Yale Professor David 
Gelernter, agents found that both men had been featured in New York Times 
articles.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Young 
&amp; Rubicam's promotion of Mosser, the bomber's most recent victim, was mentioned 
in the Wall Street Journal on December 2 and in the New York Times three days 
later.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> INCIDENTS
</p><p class="body" align="Left">.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI attributes 15 incidents to the 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> suspect, so named because five 
early episodes occurred at universities and two involved airlines.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">* MAY 25, 1978 -- Package found in parking lot of the University of Illinois in 
Chicago, with return address of a Northwestern University professor, is taken
