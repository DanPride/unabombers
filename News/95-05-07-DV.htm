<strong>Unabomber's</strong> outlook 

His avowed hatred of technology reflects growing disillusionment

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In his own lethal, deranged way, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> is a mirror of his times.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">His avowed hatred of scientific and technological trends reflects growing 
popular disillusionment with science - symbolized, one observer said, by films 
such as Terminator 2, where the heroine played by Linda Hamilton declares: 
''You (scientists) think you're so creative. All you know how to create is 
death and destruction.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The mysterious bomber has wrought much death and destruction: Since 1978, he 
has bombed 16 times, killing three people and injuring 23, including computer 
scientists, businessmen and a geneticist.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In connection with the bomber's latest attack, he sent four letters. One letter 
was to Yale University professor David Gelernter, a June 1993 Unabom victim. In 
it, the bomber derided a book by the scientist that foresaw a highly 
computerized future. He also expressed his scorn of computers and ridiculed 
Gelernter for being ''dumb enough'' to open a bomb.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Although horrified by the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> tactics, a noted American social critic, who insisted on anonymity said, ''The 
words he's using are uncomfortably close to what many (responsible) critics of 
technology are using. . . . He's a pretty good writer. I have a feeling he's 
read a 
lot of stuff.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Others are less impressed by the bomber's published defense of his bloody 
achievements. He is confused, said a computer privacy expert who - like many 
people interviewed for this story - requested anonymity for fear of attracting 
the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> wrath. He ''is using technology to create his 'Unabom.' '' the expert said. 
''He is using the very thing that he so strenuously opposes.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Environmental writer Gregg Easterbrook, whose controversial new book A Moment 
on the Earth criticizes ''dogged pessimism'' about the ecosystem, sees some 
universality in the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> distrust of technology.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''The bomber . . . is clearly a person who has lost touch with the moral 
grounding of the human race,'' he said. ''But that doesn't mean he doesn't 
reflect things that are broadly felt in society.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Those feelings include a fear that technological change, for better or worse, 
is inevitable and beyond human control - 
like the Frankenstein monster, stomping across the countryside in quest of 
victims.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Easterbrook maintains that public opinion can influence technology. He cites 
the U.S. nuclear power industry: Its growth, once seemingly inevitable, has 
stagnated from opposition.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Although authorities believe the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> despite his reference to ''we, '' is acting alone, he's hardly alone in his 
rage against science. Many blame science and its offspring, technology, for 
pornography on cable TV, for machines that force people out of work, for 
weapons that can vaporize cities.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> ''mirrors in a strange way the Oklahoma City bombers, in the sense that both 
of them are trying to set the clock back by 'whacking' it,'' said Stewart 
Brand. Brand's famed Whole Earth Catalog tries to bridge the cultural chasm 
between those who adore technology and those who dread it - between those 
who, say, surf the Internet and those whose VCRs endlessly blink 
''12:00-12:00-12:00.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''It's the rate of technological change that is punishing (to many people), '' 
Brand said. ''You have to spend more and more of your time just keeping up.  
For all but a very few, there's the feeling of 'I'm behind and I'll never catch 
up' . . . a great feeling of being left out, of the world leaving you behind.''
