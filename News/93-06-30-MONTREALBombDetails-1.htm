</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong> 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">He is quiet, fussy, and awkward with women, obsessed with making lists and 
cleaning house. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">And, authorities say, he is consumed with a rage that he vents by building and 
sending bombs to unsuspecting victims. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Federal agents say a nerdy serial bomber who was last heard from six years ago 
has returned with a vengeance, having rigged the explosives that blew up in the 
faces of two college professors on opposite coasts last week. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">And though FBI agents have assembled what they believe to be an accurate 
psychological profile of the culprit, he still remains elusive, 15 years after 
he first lashed out.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;It's a strange case - I'll let it go at that,&quot; said Bob Long, an FBI agent in Chicago. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Last Tuesday, Charles Epstein, a geneticist at the University of California-San 
Francisco, lost several fingers when a package-bomb he received in the mail 
exploded at his home. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Two days later, a bomb blew up in the office of Yale University computer 
scientist David Gelernter, sending molten shards of metal into his abdomen, 
face, chest and hands. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Since 1978, the bomber has killed one person and wounded more than 20 others in 
a bloody spree that has crisscrossed the country. While investigators have 
linked the incidents through telltale signs found in the bomb debris, the case 
has baffled them with its apparent lack of motive. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bomber targets people linked to academia, 
aviation and computers and centers his attacks mostly on Chicago, Salt Lake 
City and San Francisco. Beyond that, the blasts seem to have no common thread. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The first bomb, concealed in a wooden box, wounded a campus police officer at 
Northwestern University in Chicago. A year later, a graduate student there was 
badly burned when he picked up a bomb disguised as a cigar box. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">As the terror campaign continued, the bombs grew more sophisticated and more 
dangerous. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In November 1979, a bomb exploded in the cargo hold of an American Airlines jet 
en route from Chicago to Washington, sending smoke pouring into the cabin and 
forcing an emergency landing at Dulles Airport in suburban Virginia. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Authorities found that the bomb had been rigged to go off when the plane 
reached 6,500 
feet. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In July 1982, 63-year-old Diogenes Angelakos, professor of electrical 
engineering and computer science at the University of California-Berkeley, saw 
what looked vaguely like a gasoline tank sitting in a lunchroom. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I reached over for the handle, and as soon as I lifted it I knew something was 
wrong,&quot; Angelakos recalled. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;It was too quick for me to let go. Just as I tried to lift it up, it went off.&quot; The blast mangled Angelakos' right hand. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">But that was not Angelakos's last brush with the phantom bomber. Three years 
later, just two floors below where Angelakos had been hurt, John Hauser, a 
26-year-old air force captain and graduate student, opened a package bomb left 
in a university computer room. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
explosion blew off much of Hauser's right hand and damaged one eye. Angelakos 
heard the blast and rushed to help. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The injuries ended Hauser's dream of becoming an astronaut. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A few months later, 38-year-old Campbell Scrutton found a package outside the 
back door of his computer store in Sacramento, Calif. When he touched it, a 
bomb inside exploded, spraying shrapnel hundreds of feet. He died half an hour 
later. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">FBI agents thought they had a break in the case in 1987, when a witness in Salt 
Lake City saw a man plant a device an hour before it exploded, wounding a 
computer store employee. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The suspect was described as in his late 20s, 5-feet-10 to 6 feet tall, with 
blond or 
sun-bleached hair and a reddish complexion. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Agents from the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the U.S. 
Postal Service established a task force, dubbed 
&quot;<strong>Unabom,</strong>&quot; for university bomber. A $ 50,000 reward was offered. A hotline was set up to 
receive tips. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">But the trail grew cold. Six years went by without a new explosion. and 
authorities wondered if the murderous spree had ended. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Then, last week, bomb experts examined debris from the New Haven and San 
Francisco explosions and made a nightmarish discovery - both bombs were made 
from the same store-bought materials used in the previous bombings and came in 
packages bearing markings from Sacramento. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The serial bomber was back. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Investigators are in a bind. To nab the phantom bomber, they must understand 
his motivations. Their psychological profiles indicate that he is angry 
at some person or group and is seeking revenge. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The question is not whether this is a revenge killing so much as against which 
group,&quot; Levin said. 
&quot;If we don't understand that, we will not bring this person to justice.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Others hope something else happens. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;We hoped he had blown himself up,&quot; Angelakos said.
