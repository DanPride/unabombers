</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
 APOLOGIES FOR VIOLENCE LEAD TO VIOLENCE
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Editor -- Edmund Hanauer (''Terrorism and American Policy,'' Open Forum, May 
19) falls into the same tiresome distortions about ''moral equivalence'' which 
should have been discredited by now. It's not only intellectually lazy, it 
provides rhetorical camouflage for those who would like nothing better than to 
stop the peace process.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Asserting that possibilities for peace are ''endangered equally (italics mine) 
by Palestinian terrorism and Israel's oppressive occupation policies'' is nice 
and symmetrical, but that doesn't make it right. There is an enormous 
difference: acts of violence committed by soldier or settler are condemned by 
Israel's elected government, and those perpetrating such crimes have been 
arrested and convicted in Israel's courts.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Yasser Arafat's whispered denunciations, only after international arm-twisting, 
of terrorist acts committed by Palestinians, are not 
exactly profiles in political courage. To say that Hamas and Islamic Jihad 
members are not under Arafat's control is a pathetic defense.  Baruch Goldstein 
was not a Labor Party activist -- but Rabin and his government unequivocally 
denounced his act for what it was, because he was an Israeli. Yasser Arafat 
should do no less about the acts committed by Palestinians. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mr. Hanauer can repeat the ''one man's terrorist is another's freedom fighter'' 
mantra as much as he'd like, it doesn't make it true. Firing on bases of 
operations in southern Lebanon, whose purpose is to train fighters to carry out 
operations against one's country, is not the same thing as blowing up commuter 
buses in downtown Tel Aviv. And trying to equate (there's that word again) the 
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait with Israel's repulsion of Egyptian troops, massed for 
their own invasion, from Gaza in 1967, is simply absurd.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Finally, and most dangerously, Hanauer twists President Kennedy's words about 
the inevitability of ''violent revolution'' and declares that ''Clinton's 
policies make it impossible for Palestinians to achieve their rights 
nonviolently . . .'' Doesn't an ''anything goes'' argument like this justify 
terrorism? At such a delicate 
time in the peace process, apologies for acts of violence will only bring about 
more violence.

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 'IT DOESN'T MATTER'
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Editor -- The Chronicle argues that President Clinton should fire Ron Brown. It 
doesn't matter that Ron Brown is regarded by many in the business community as 
the most effective secretary of commerce ever. It doesn't matter that Ron Brown 
has helped secure billions of dollars in new markets overseas for American 
companies. It doesn't matter that, for those of us who remember the more than 
150 indictments of the Reagan administration, the Clinton presidency receives 
high marks for probity, integrity and government openness.  No, Ron Brown is 
the object of an accusation, and that alone, regardless of the merit of the 
charge, is the source of so much embarrassment 
for the president that it cannot be tolerated.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">I think it's only fair to let you know that a number of people -- I won't say 
who -- have told me that the editorial team of The Chronicle accepted money to 
write that piece about Ron Brown. In light of this accusation, it's clear that 
the only way to preserve the good name of The Chronicle will be to have the 
entire team resign by the end of the week. I'll be forwarding my resume for the 
ensuing vacancies under separate cover.

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> COURAGE
</p><p class="body" align="Left">EDITOR -- I am sick of hearing young whippersnappers like Representative Kasich 
blather about the courage of the Republicans in putting together their balanced 
budget, designed to balance the budget in seven years.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">They have put together a budget that slashes services for the neediest, while 
cutting taxes for those fat 
cats who supported the Republican takeover of Congress. And, of course, 
congresspersons are also in the tax bracket that will benefit from cuts and 
reductions in capital-gains taxes.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">I would like to remind Representative Kasich that it is people like me who need 
the courage . . . seniors who will find that Medicare covers far less of their 
medical expenses. Mothers with dependent children will need to bear up as well, 
as will students trying to find educational loans to enable them to go to 
college.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Yes, I think many of us need a lot more courage than Representative Kasich, and 
that other brave man, Newt Gingrich. A good memory would help, too, to remind 
those noble leaders that most of that deficit they are so worried about now was 
run up during the Reagan and Bush years!

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> PENTAGON PORK
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Editor -- 
Thank you for printing William Safire's article (''The GOP Delivers'') on May 
17. It's refreshing to hear the Republican point of view regarding the upcoming 
budget battle in Washington.  Through cutting funding of the national service, 
PBS and all art in general, Mr. Safire's conclusion is this: ''the best way to 
redirect our nation is stronger government spending restraint plus tax 
reduction.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">I find it humorous that his reasoning equates scrapping those programs with a 
balanced budget. Scrapping all of public broadcasting wouldn't buy us one B-2 
Stealth Bomber (bombers which actually aren't very stealthy). We've got a whole 
fleet of nuclear subs swimming around out there, keeping the whales company, 
with no enemy to track.  Our military spending (per GNP) is that of a nation at 
war, and yet our rail 
service, education and national enhancement programs are under-funded to the 
point where they can't work.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">If Mr. Safire and the Republican Party are so interested in balancing the 
budget, maybe they should check out the cost of a peacetime military. A little 
scrutiny at the Pentagon's budget might reveal the balanced budget they've been 
looking for.

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> BOMBER TAGS
</p><p class="body" align="Left">EDitor -- I fail to see the logic in referring to the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> as an anarchist bomber. The Chron does not attach the adjective Christian to 
the Christians who assassinate women's clinic workers and bomb clinics. Nor are 
the suspects in the Oklahoma bombing described as capitalist bombers though 
they are very frank in advocating an unregulated free market. And I have yet to 
see the words ''government bombers'' used to describe AFT/FBI officers in the 
Waco disaster or the Philadelphia Police 
Department in the MOVE firebombing. If you are going to use the word anarchist 
to describe the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> please be consistent in regards to others' political or ideological 
associations.

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> PACIFIC WAR REUNION
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Editor -- Since the end of World War II, almost 50 years ago, I have seen, read 
and heard, almost exclusively, coverage of the European Theater of Operations, 
but very little coverage of the Pacific war, which I considered ''our personal 
conflict.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Some of the obvious past oversights, by the media, can be corrected during the 
forthcoming reunion of the Alamo Scouts, Sixth Army, World War II, and the 
former prisoners of war liberated from the POW camp at Cabanatuan, Philippine 
Islands.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The reunion will take place at The Villa Hotel, 4000 El Camino Real, San Mateo, 
(415) 341-0966, on June 1 
through June 3.

ritual since 1975.

stable human relationships?
