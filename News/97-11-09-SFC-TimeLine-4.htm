Bombs When Theodore J. Kaczynski goes on trial this week, the government will 
try 



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> Michael Taylor, Chronicle Staff Writer 



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>DATELINE:</strong> Sacramento 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He was the ultimate Luddite, a professed hater of technology. And yet, the 
government says, he was also the wizard of technology, a superb craftsman who 
used his vast knowledge of physics and math to master the intricate art of 
bomb-making.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He outwitted and frustrated a federal posse for nearly 18 years, content to lob 
bombs from the cellar of anonymity. But then his ego overrode his sense of 
caution, as he forced his abstruse writings on the world, and he was arrested 
in a matter of months -- turned in by his own brother, who had recognized the 
odd turn of phrase.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">For a quarter of a century, the hermit lived in a rustic cabin in rural 
Montana, a packrat who saved everything that came to hand -- scraps of paper, 
bits of wire, newspaper articles, journals, notebooks, copies of letters, all 
of which may soon prove to be the engine of his 
undoing.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">When the trial of Theodore J. Kaczynski begins in the federal court of Judge 
Garland Burrell Jr. Wednesday , assuming there are no last-minute 
postponements, prosecutors Robert Cleary, R. Steven Lapham and Stephen Freccero 
will be using Kaczynski's hoard to try and hang the former professor by his own 
words -- the thousands of pages of journals found in Kaczynski's home that 
detailed every single bombing and examined them over and over, like a jeweler 
cutting and polishing a diamond, facet by facet. Word by word.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''Experiment 97. Dec. 11, 1985, I planted bomb disguised to look like scrap of 
lumber behind Rentech Compute (SIC) Store in Sacramento. According to San 
Francisio (sic) Examiner, Dec.20, The 'operator' (owner? manager?) of the store 
was killed, 'blown to bits.' ''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Kaczynski, the bearded, 
slight, soft-spoken and brilliant mathematician who chats animatedly with his 
lawyers, Quin Denvir, Judy Clarke and Gary Sowards. Kaczynski, the mentally 
diseased loner, those lawyers say, who should not be put to death.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Then there's the Kaczynski who, federal prosecutors believe, coldly and 
methodically perfected his methods of murder, honing his skills and keeping up 
his ''lab notes,'' much like the graduate student he once was, detailing each 
of the 16 bombing incidents of which he is suspected and chortling in writing 
about how he was thwarting the UNABOM Task Force.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Kaczynski, according to the federal government, is the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> -- the mysterious killer who planted or mailed bombs all over the country 
between 1978 and 1995 in a campaign of terror that took the lives of three 
people and injured 23 others. UNABOM is a government acronym that comes from a 
contraction of ''university'' and ''airline,'' the first of his targets.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Kaczynski, who is 55, was arrested April 3, 1996, at his cabin near Lincoln, 
Mont. He is charged in Sacramento with planting or mailing bombs that killed 
computer store owner Hugh Scrutton in 1985 and timber lobbyist Gilbert Murray 
10 years later. He is also charged with sending bombs in 1993 that injured Yale 
computer scientist David Gelernter and University of California at San 
Francisco geneticist Charles Epstein. And in a separate indictment in New 
Jersey, he has been charged with the mail-bomb of advertising executive Thomas 
Mosser.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">If convicted in the California case, Kaczynski could receive the death penalty, 
and the government is doing its best to see that that happens.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The case seems more complex because there were so many bombings and, perforce, 
a myriad of evidence, but in the end, it is still a straightforward criminal 
prosecution. The federal 
lawyers will put forensic experts on the 
<strong>witness</strong> stand and will also put federal agents on the 
<strong>witness</strong> stand.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But the real meat of the case will come when they show the jurors the mountain 
of material found in Kaczynski's cabin. A compulsive collector, he kept copies 
of nearly every letter he wrote, he kept copies of his 35,000-word 
anti-technology manifesto, he kept the typewriter that wrote all those letters 
and the manifesto, and he kept all the tools and all the little bits and pieces 
that went into making bombs. He even kept a fully functional bomb that the 
government says is nearly identical to many of the bombs used by the 
<strong>Unabomber.</strong> Sort of a working model. For reference.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''In the late 1970s,'' federal prosecutors wrote in one of their pretrial 
briefs, Kaczynski ''recorded the details of his first bombing, and he continued 
memorializing his bombing 
activities through the final entries.  (His) journals contain extensive 
discussions of Kaczynski's . . . ideology and motivations, and expressions of 
his intent to kill his victims. Briefly stated, Kaczynski despised anyone who 
interfered with the solitude that he craved, and he harbored a deep-seated 
hatred of certain aspects of modern technological and industrial society.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The defense lawyers have pleaded their client not guilty and have been pretty 
circumspect about what they will say in Kaczynski's defense -- there has not 
been much talk about the possibility that the feds got the wrong man. The 
defense has not made a big case for the idea that any of the more than 2,000 
other suspects investigated by the UNABOM task force should be on trial, rather 
than their client. Over last summer and early fall, Kaczynski's lawyers began 
filing court documents that say they will probably bring in a psychiatrist or 
two to testify 
about paranoid schizophrenia and how this may relate to Kaczynski, and, more 
realistically, how this possible ''mental disease or defect,'' as the lawyers 
call it, may have an impact on the jury that could vote to execute the client.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In a larger sense, though, the public is watching this case intently, because 
it was the longest-running serial bombing in U.S. history, and when the alleged 
bomber was finally caught, he did not fit all those notions we have about our 
criminals.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''Here's what makes this case interesting,'' said Nanci Clarence, a former 
federal public defender now in private practice in San Francisco.  ''The FBI 
has been leaking all this forensic evidence for years, but what do we know 
about Ted Kaczynski, about what makes him tick? Not very much. It's a 
fascinating story, because he doesn't fit the prototype of a crazed criminal. 
He's a Harvard- educated 
genius, an American success story kind of run amok. How did he get from there 
to here?''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He grew up in a bookish left-wing Chicago family, was a member of the Science 
Club in high school, and after Harvard went to the University of Michigan for 
his Ph.D. He taught math at the University of California at Berkeley from 1967 
to 1969 and, as one observer of the case said the other day, ''if he hadn't 
turned into a bombing lunatic hermit, he'd still be in Berkeley, reading the 
New York Times at Cafe Roma on Bancroft and driving a battered old Volvo.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Instead, after his stint as a math professor ended, Kaczynski disappeared. With 
his brother, David, he bought a piece of land outside the small town of 
Lincoln, Mont., built himself a 10-foot-by-12-foot cabin, sans electricity or running water, and burrowed in. Alone.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bombings began on May 25, 1978, when a woman found a package in a parking 
lot at the University of Illinois' Chicago Circle campus. The package was 
addressed to a professor of engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic in Troy, 
N.Y., and had a return address of a professor at Northwestern University. 
Suspicions aroused, the woman called the Northwestern professor, who called 
police. When an officer opened the package, it exploded, injuring him slightly.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Three more Chicago bombs followed -- two in 1979 and one in 1980. One of the 
1979 bombs exploded in the hold of an airliner heading from Chicago to 
Washington, D.C. The bomber had figured out how to modify a barometer to act as 
a switch, setting 
off the device when the airplane reached a certain altitude.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The pattern of bombs, however, was not something anyone could pin down.  Over 
the years, bombs were placed near or mailed to targets in Utah, Tennessee, 
Washington, Michigan, Connecticut, New Jersey and California.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Most of the bombs exploded, but like any experimenter who is honing his craft, 
he had his problems.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A bomb placed at the University of Utah in October 1981 was found by police.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''I attempted a bombing and spent nearly three hundred bucks just for travel 
expenses, motel, clothing for disguise, etc.,'' Kaczynski wrote in his journal. 
''Aside from cost of materials for the bomb. and then the thing failed to 
explode. Damn.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">And in a rare critique of the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> manufacturing prowess, a government agent wrote, ''despite meticulous 
handicraft, all but 
one of the bombs were characterized by excess solder.'' Excess or not, the 
bombs kept coming, and from then on, with one exception, they all worked.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But there was still no discernible logic to the bombing campaign. No 
communiques from the bomber, no evidence of a grudge against a particular 
university or airline. Between June 1980 and July 1982, there were only four 
bombs. In 1985 alone, however, there were four -- one of them, in Sacramento, 
brought the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> his first fatality. In 1987, when the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> placed a device in a Salt Lake City parking lot, a woman caught a glimpse of 
him as he stood up. This resulted in the infamous sketch showing a 
sweatshirt-hooded man wearing dark glasses. Driven underground by an apparent 
excess of caution, he did not bomb again for six years -- until 
June 1993.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">That is also when he decided to go public, a move that would ultimately bring 
him down. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">At about the same time he sent bombs to Epstein and Gelernter, he wrote to the 
New York Times saying he was the designated representative of an anarchist 
group called ''FC.'' (FC stood for ''Freedom Club,'' according to a copy of a 
1985 letter found in Kaczynski's cabin. FC was found stamped on the end plates 
of some of the bombs.)
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The killing resumed in December 1994, when Mosser, the advertising executive, 
was decapitated after opening a package he had received in the mail at his New 
Jersey home. In April 1995, one day after the Oklahoma City bombing, the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> last victim, Gilbert Murray, died when he opened a mail bomb at the Sacramento 
headquarters of the California Forestry association.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In 1995, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> became a creature of the spotlight: He wrote the New York Times, offering to 
''desist from terrorism'' if the Times published his 35,000-word manifesto. He 
wrote The Chronicle, threatening to blow up an airplane at Los Angeles 
International Airport. He sent his manifesto to the Times and other 
publications, as well as to UC Berkeley professor Tom Tyler, whose public 
comments comparing the Oklahoma City bombing with the UNABOM case had irked 
him. Over the summer of 1995, editors of the few newspapers that had obtained 
leaked copies of the manifesto dithered over whether to publish it, most of 
them deciding not to.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI agent in charge of the investigation, Jim R. Freeman, quietly urged 
publication, figuring -- correctly, as it turned out -- that if the manifesto 
was out there, somebody would pick up on it, would see something in that dense 
thicket of anti-technology hysteria that would ring a few 
bells.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''We were trying to smoke the guy out,'' Freeman, who retired from the bureau 
last year, said the other day. ''The manifesto was the key to everything. Most 
serial bombers write manifestos, claim credit and get it off their chest. But 
(the 
<strong>Unabomber)</strong> kept his mouth shut for so many years.  Once he came forward, it made sense to 
get the manifesto out.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Freeman said the FBI and the Department of Justice made a ''very high-level 
approach'' to the New York Times and the Washington Post, the two newspapers in 
which the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> had demanded publication.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In September 1995, the Post, in a joint venture with the Times, bent to the 
demands of the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> and the request by the FBI -- it was not a high point in the history of a free 
press, journalism critics said later -- and published the manifesto. Within 
months, 
David Kaczynski, racked with an increasing sense of foreboding, determined that 
it could easily have been written by his brother.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">By February 1996, he and his mother, Wanda, had made the wrenching decision to 
go to the FBI, through intermediaries, and within weeks, Theodore J. Kaczynski 
was under surveillance in Montana. When he was arrested on April 3, he was 
docile and polite, like the professor he had once been.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Once they had Kaczynski, the task force investigators, who had spent more than 
$ 50 million trying to find the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> suddenly began to see the 17-year pattern. It all started to fit, given the 
background of their prime suspect.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The first four bombs ''were placed in or mailed from the Chicago area, where 
(Kaczynski) was born and lived for many years, including the years 1978 to 
1980, when those bombs exploded,'' prosecutors said in one of their briefs.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''Bombs 5 and 12 (placed in 
Salt Lake City), bomb 6 (mailed from Provo, Utah), and bomb 10 (mailed from 
Salt Lake City) were connected to an area where (Kaczynski) had worked from 
late 1972 to early 1973. Bomb 10 was mailed to a professor at the University of 
Michigan, where Kaczynski obtained his Ph.D. Bombs 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15 and 
16 were mailed from or placed in Northern California, where the defendant 
taught as a college professor. Indeed, bombs 7 and 8 were placed at the same 
university at which Kaczynski taught, the University of California at Berkeley. 
Bomb 17 was found inside Kaczynski's cabin.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">They also found in the lab notes, that, like a chemistry professor doing 
endless research, Kaczynski was obsessed with finding what worked best.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He ''frequently tinkered with the number and types of batteries that he used in 
his bombs,'' the prosecutors 
wrote, so when he said in a lab note that he used six D-cells in bomb 8, eight 
in bomb 9, four D's and six triple A's in bomb 10, and so forth, ''in each 
instance, the physical proof recovered at the crime scene corroborates 
Kaczynski's account of the batteries he used.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">It seems like damning evidence, and many veteran defense attorneys conceded 
that it doesn't look good for Kaczynski, which is one of the reasons, experts 
say, that the defense is raising the issue of Kaczynski's mental health.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''This is tactically a more attractive defense,'' Stephen Meagher, a former 
federal prosecutor said. ''It shifts the burden to the prosecution because (the 
defense attorneys) are arguing that the defendant didn't have the capacity to 
form the requisite intent. You have to have specific intent to kill or injure. 
You have to prove that he had the intent not 
only to do the acts, but also to have those results.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But there is also an overarching strategy, many experts say, that goes not so 
much to whether Kaczynski did it, but to whether he should ultimately be put to 
death.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In one of the case's many ironies, his family turned him in with the hope that 
Attorney General Janet Reno, grateful to have the suspect practically delivered 
to her, would not seek the death penalty. It didn't turn out that way, so the 
family's only hope of keeping Kaczynski alive, should he be convicted, lies in 
how the defense gets across to the jury that their client is psychologically 
unbalanced.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''What's really going on here,'' Meagher said, ''is about the death penalty. 
It's not about guilt or innocence. The point is that even if he's legally 
guilty, he is so screwed up that he is not somebody we should put to death.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">If anyone should know how to get that across, it should be Judy Clarke, the 
veteran public defender who is 
one of Kaczynski's lawyers. Two years ago, she defended Susan Smith, the South 
Carolina mother who drove her two toddlers into a lake and left them in her car 
to drown.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Early on in the Smith trial, Clarke and her co-counsel David Bruck, ''were able 
to interject some issues'' about Smith's mental health, according to South 
Carolina prosecutor Tommy Pope, who tried the case. The jury apparently 
listened well when Clarke and Bruck argued that the young mother was not 
malicious, but was suicidal and mentally unstable. The jury decided she was not 
someone they wanted to see executed and gave her life in prison instead.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">With Kaczynski, defense lawyers say, assuming the ex-professor is convicted, it 
will all come down to the penalty phase of the trial, when the jury in 
Sacramento decides what punishment the bomber should get.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">It is 
likely that the defense lawyers will ask Kaczynski's mother to testify, to 
offer some insight into how her son made that journey, as attorney Nanci 
Clarence put it, ''from there to here.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Wanda Kaczynski may very well repeat what she told the Washington Post in an 
interview two months after her son was arrested. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">She said that when Ted was 9 months old, his body suddenly became covered with 
hives. She took him to the hospital, where he spent a week being examined by 
doctors for what appeared to be a severe allergic reaction.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">She remembers him being absolutely terrified by the experience, according to 
the Post account, and she wonders, half a century later, whether this 
contributed to her son's slowly evolving anger.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''I ponder endlessly over it,'' she said in that interview. ''What could I have 
done to keep him out of the wilderness? What could I have done to give him a 
happier life? And yet there were 
so many happy, wonderful times with the family. I just don't know. I just don't 
know.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Who does?
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 'MR. STRANGER-DANGER'
</p><p class="body" align="Left">.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">When you think of big, high-profile serial killers, the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> in the eyes of many experts was unusual -- for two decades, he stayed 
resolutely anonymous, refusing to meld into the showy criminal mainstream of 
random killers who taunt the public with letters, such as San Francisco's 
Zodiac killer.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But once the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> went public with his voluminous writings -- in the summer and fall of 1995 -- 
it took less than a year to catch the brilliant ex-mathematician, Theodore J. 
Kaczynski, hoisted on the petard of his own prose. And now Kaczynski has 
reached what even he might think is that mundane level of notoriety, With 
websites, books and hundreds of articles devoted to him. He is squarely in the 
American pantheon of notorious crime figures.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''We've seen this in all kinds of B-movies,'' Scott Turow, best-selling crime 
novelist and former federal prosecutor, said in an interview. ''Ted Kaczynski 
is 'Mr. Stranger- Danger' in person. He's the bogeyman. He's Rex Luthor. He's 
an evil genius, and he went to Harvard. The notion of some hermit committing 
ruthless and random bombings is really not a new story.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">As serial bombers go, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> had the longest run of any of them, but in the 1950s, the country was 
transfixed by a mad bomber who had planted 32 bombs in the New York area 
between 1940 and 1957. George Metesky, a disgruntled former employee of 
Consolidated Edison Co., was caught after he began communicating with a New 
York newspaper.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">After he confessed, he was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic and sent to a 
state hospital 
for the criminally insane. He was released in 1973 and died in a Waterbury 
convalescent home in May 1994 at the age of 90.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Metesky's main beef was with a utility. The 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> went much further -- targeting, in his letters and tracts, the vast culture of 
technology, with all its social ramifications.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''In a way, he's kind of a '60s fallout, a product of Berkeley at that time and 
place,'' said San Francisco novelist Richard North Patterson, who also a 
lawyer. Patterson said that 20 and 30 years ago, radicalism had its pockets of 
popularity.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''But now in the '90s, people are worried,'' Patterson said, and the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> is seen more as ''the seedy neighbor on the block, the man you don't want your 
kids to play with. His political agenda is so beyond the pale that I think more 
people are inclined to 
view him for what he is -- a mentally disturbed person whose politics are an 
expression of his maladjustment and are not to be taken seriously. He's being 
viewed as a killer, not as a political figure.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">One man who views the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> with a certain familiarity most of us don't have is David Gelernter, the Yale 
computer scientist who opened what he thought was an envelope containing a 
graduate student's thesis on June 24, 1993, only to have his right hand and 
other parts of his body mangled by a powerful bomb.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Gelernter survived -- barely -- and he wrote a book about his experiences, 
calling it, ''Drawing Life: Surviving the 
<strong>Unabomber.</strong>''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Like Patterson, Gelernter points to that 1960s and '70s part of U.S.  history 
when radicalism was chic -- or at least more chic than it is now -- and says, 
''relatively few people do it anymore, but there is 
still an approach to life that makes heroes of murderers -- whether it's 
Palestinian terrorists or the Viet Cong or the Khmer Rouge. That attitude has 
left a profound cultural residue.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">And what if he had a chance to talk to Kaczynski?
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''Never in a million years would I sink to the level of talking to him,'' he 
says. ''I think he should be executed.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">THE 
<strong>UNABOMBER</strong> EVIDENCE
</p><p class="body" align="Left">.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">What government prosecutors plan to use at trial:
</p><p class="body" align="Left">1. The typewriter ''used to type all identifiable 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> correspondence since 1982. This typewriter ties Kaczynski to mailing labels 
and correspondence'' found on or near seven of the bombs and to letters written 
to The Chronicle and the New York Times.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">2. A carbon copy of the 35,000- word anti-technology manifesto -- the original 
went to the New York Times -- and a handwritten draft of the manifesto.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">3. Handwritten or carbon copies of letters sent by the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> including ''those that accompanied 
bombs, letters to the New York Times, and cover letters'' to other publications 
and individuals.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">4. A handwritten autobiography, written in 1979, ''which contains the statement 
that Kaczynski intends to start killing people and that the purpose of the 
autobiography is to explain that he is not sick.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">5. Notebooks, mostly in Spanish or code and journals in English ''which 
together contain admissions or inculpatory statements to each of the 16 bombing 
incidents.'' Kaczynski's lawyers have already conceded that the journals, 
notebooks, autobiography and nearly every other document in the cabin were 
created by Kaczynski.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">6. Three-ring binders ''which memorialize Kaczynski's experiments over the 
years with various types of bombs and explosive chemical compounds.  These 
experiments show a clear progression in Kaczynski's bomb-making capabilities, 
describe the construction of several of the UNABOM devices and how each was 
deployed.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">7. A piece of paper with the 
10-digit code (553-25-4394) that the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> used to 
<strong>identify</strong> himself to his correspondents, such as the New York Times.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">8. Green paneling nails forensically matched to the same kind of nails ''used 
as shrapnel in the (Gilbert) Murray and (Thomas) Mosser bombs.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">9. A ''fully functional'' bomb ''similar in design and construction to the 
Murray bomb and components of which can be forensically associated with 
components of the (Charles) Epstein and (David) Gelernter bombs.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">10. ''Various bomb components including triggers, initiators, pipes and 
chemicals.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">11. Bomb-making chemicals, bits and pieces of wire and ''a unique pivot switch 
virtually identical'' to the switches found in the Epstein, Mosser and 
Gelernter bombs; and tools ''such as hand drills, drill bits, files, 
screwdrivers, planing equipment, wire cutters/pliers, and a vise.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">12. ''Testimony of
