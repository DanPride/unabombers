Federal agents in Montana yesterday took into custody a former University of
California at Berkeley assistant professor whom they suspect is the infamous
Unabomber, whose intricate, wooden explosive devices claimed three lives and
injured 23 others over a 17- year period. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
The man being interrogated was identified as Theodore John Kaczynski, 53, a
former assistant math professor whose own brother tipped off federal agents
that Kaczynski could be the man who had eluded a massive manhunt for so many
years. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
''This is him,'' said one knowledgeable source, who declined to be named. ''We
think we've got him.'' 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
The break in the case came about three months ago, sources said, when the
Kaczynski family began cleaning up their home in Lombard, Ill. -- readying it
for sale. In old boxes, they found writings left behind by Theodore Kaczynski
that were similar to the Unabomber's manifesto. His brother, David, a
45-year-old assistant director of a social services agency in Schenectady,
N.Y., called an attorney acquaintance in Washington, D. C., and the attorney
turned the evidence over to the FBI. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
As of last night, Kaczynski was being held in Helena, Mont., but he had not
been formally arrested or charged. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Agents said Kaczynski was taken into custody so he would not hamper the search
of his isolated cabin near a mountain pass on the Continental Divide. Sheriff's
deputies reported that 20 FBI agents then conducted a meticulous search of the
cabin. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
But the cabin's rough exterior gave no hint of what lay inside. A neighbor told
the Washington Post the 10-foot-by-12-foot cabin was ''wall-to-wall books,''
the only indication that the reclusive mountain man had another life as a
Harvard- trained mathematician. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
It was not known late last night whether the search uncovered any of the key
evidence that could definitely link Kaczynski to the case -- including any
bomb-making tools, wood supplies that could have been used to construct the bombs
or the typewriter the Unabomber used. A source told the Associated Press last
night that the search uncovered no such evidence. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
One member of the UNABOM task force -- made up of dozens of agents and is
headquartered in San Francisco -- said Kaczynski's brother David gave the FBI
Theodore's name ''a long time ago'' and has been striving to have them listen
to him ever since. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
But another FBI official said the lead ''was given a high priority and special
attention from the beginning.'' That focus occurred in part, the official said,
because it came to the Washington field office. The agent explained that office
had far fewer tips to cope with than the San Francisco office, where the
investigation was centered and tips flooded in. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Armed with the tip about the writings, agents quickly launched a further search
of the Kaczynskis' suburban Chicago home, where Kaczynski lived before
attending Harvard and the University of Michigan, agents said. As one source
put it, the investigation's results in the Chicago area quickly gave credence
to the idea that Kaczynski just might be the Unabomber. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
PURSUERS TAUNTED 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
If Kaczynski is is determined to be the Unabomber, it would mean the
culmination of the longest search in the nation's history for a serial bomber.
In those years, the Unabomber used the U.S. mail system to send nine of his
bombs, taunted his pursuers and demanded that major newspapers run his lengthy
attacks on the evils of technology's proliferation. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
In recent months, sources said the FBI had half a dozen good suspects, but one
by one, they appeared less likely to be the man agents sought. The more time
passed, the more the suspect in Montana -- Kaczynski -- began looking like the
man they wanted, sources said. In so many ways, including his solitary
lifestyle, Kaczynski fit the profile experts had constructed of the Unabomber. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
The first bomb linked to the Unabomber was found May 25, 1978, in a parking lot
at Northwestern University outside Chicago. Since then, there have been 15 more
attacks tied to the Unabomber -- with the most recent occurring April 24, 1995,
when timber industry executive Gilbert Murray was killed opening a package
delivered to his Sacramento office. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
UNUSUAL BOMBS 
<a name=Grooves></p><p class="body" align="Left">
Time and again, the Unabomber used aluminum and polished hardwood to craft
sophisticated bombs that experts said they had never seen the likes of before.
Early on, agents gave him the name of ''Unabomber'' because his targets were
often related to universities and airlines. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
</a><a href="../Witnesses.htm#Grooves">Retired
FBI bomb expert Christopher Ronay described in an interview the technical
ability of the Unabomber. He told how one of the bombs the Unabomber used had a
unique wooden dowel &quot;with grooves cut into it on each side for the wire. There
were identical wire leads, and so on. I had never seen the design before in the
thousands of bombs I had examined.&quot;</a>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Last year the Unabomber wrote to the New York Times, claiming he was ''getting
tired of making bombs,'' and offering a deal. If the Times or some other national
publication would print his lengthy manifesto, ''we will permanently desist
from terrorist activities.'' He claimed to be an anarchist -- a claim anarchist
experts around the United States questioned. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
SEARCH FOR EMBITTERED LEFTIST 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Agents who pored over his letter for clues soon began knocking on doors in the
more radical corners of Berkeley and San Francisco, thinking that maybe the
Unabomber was a leftover leftist -- bitter, burned out and bombing his way
through life. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
On June 27, a letter arrived at The Chronicle, in which the Unabomber
threatened to ''blow up an airliner out of Los Angeles International Airport.''
It was a convincing message that was quickly authenticated by the FBI. The
author had included the first two digits of his five-digit New York Times
identifying number. Within hours, the Federal Aviation Administration had
thrown a massive security blanket over all California airports. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Flights were delayed. Passengers stood in long lines to have their tickets
matched against photo identification. The mail system was disrupted because
officials feared bombs would be sent on airplanes. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
The day after that publicity coup, the Unabomber struck again: Packages
containing his 35,000-word typewritten manifesto, outlining in laborious detail
his political philosophy about the alleged destructiveness of modern
technology, arrived at the offices of the New York Times, the Washington Post
and Penthouse magazine. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
DEMAND TO PRINT MANIFESTO 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
In a move that immediately gave heartburn to news executives at both papers,
the Unabomber said he would stop killing people if one of the two papers
printed the manifesto -- in full -- by the end of September. If they refused
this demand, and the Unabomber had to settle for having his views published in
the less respectable Penthouse, he said he would ''reserve the right'' to kill
once again. In either event, he said he would still keep committing acts of
sabotage, but would try not to kill anyone. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Last September, the New York Times and the Washington Post published the
Unabomber's essay on the evils of the industrial age. There have been no
bombings since then. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
For the last few weeks, FBI agents in Montana have been shadowing Kaczynski's
every move, but uncovered nothing obviously suspicious. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Their work was made more difficult by the fact that Kaczynski ''lived in the
middle of nowhere,'' one source said. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
In California, at least one of the Unabomber's victims was hoping that the man
in FBI custody was indeed the long-sought bomber. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Diogenes Angelakos, a University of California at Berkeley professor emeritus
of electrical engineering who was injured in a 1982 bombing at UC Berkeley,
said: ''If it is the guy, I'm glad for the next guy that could have been
bombed. He's hurt people; he's maimed people.''
