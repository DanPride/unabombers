</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Last year, the Johns Hopkins University awarded doctoral degrees to 311 
students, and Robert Stephen Dobkin wasn't one of them. He didn't graduate from 
Hopkins; he sued Hopkins. And Dobkin vs. Hopkins has become the story of his 
life. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">At its simplest, a benign academic disagreement between one smart student and 
one smart university escalated into dueling multimillion-dollar lawsuits when 
Hopkins sued back. At its most sensational, the swamp of accusations from both 
sides mentions fraud, slander, cheating, sexual harassment, mental illness, 
cover-ups and even the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> -- the person mailing murderous letter bombs. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The only crime not alleged was arson,&quot; says Rob Dobkin -- Yale man, cancer survivor, litigant.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Both sides have been phonetically and legally joined at the hips for two years. 
Rob sued first. The university says it doesn't award degrees because people 
sue. Rob says he earned his degree and will not be intimidated. Nor will 
Hopkins, which flexed its legal might to defend its name. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Neither side will speak without attorneys. Most of the details and quotations 
for this story were mined from the mountain of paper produced by the lawsuits 
-- depositions, personal letters, faxes and e-mail records. The telling and 
only meeting with Rob comes later. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">His case could go to trial in Baltimore or end unceremoniously with a short 
order by a federal judge. Either way, Rob Dobkin might never feel vindicated. 
Because for all the charges in this case, the most inflammatory claim felt by 
37-year-old 
Robert Dobkin might well be this: 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The man wasn't smart enough. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">* 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Rob Dobkin's mind and body are the heart of this story. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Robbie is a true academic,&quot; says his mother, Rosalyn Dobkin. She and her husband, Donald, raised their 
family in Livingston, N.J. Robbie was such a bright boy, taking an interest in 
philosophy, law and medicine. Robbie was such a sick boy. He developed a 
disease called Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, which can prematurely age the internal 
organs. In Rob's case, the acute disease was initiated by a drug prescribed to 
him in childhood. (The Dobkins' medical malpractice claim was settled in 1993 
for a 
&quot;substantial amount,&quot; says attorney Henry Kaufman.) 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The bulk of his existence, since age 3, has been involved with accommodating to 
the systematic ravages of that degenerative fallout,&quot; his parents have said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The sickly boy became a 
tenacious scholar. He earned a bachelor's degree in politics from Bennington 
College in Vermont in June 1978. At 21, he enrolled in graduate school at 
Brandeis University to pursue a doctoral degree in political theory. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Rob found that the faculty had a narrower approach to his program as well as an 
incompatible political orientation,&quot; wrote Mr. Kaufman, who has been advising Rob. It was agreed that Rob would 
leave Brandeis with a master's in politics. It wouldn't be the last time Rob 
butted brains with a prominent school. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">* 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">When Rob was 26, he was diagnosed with bladder cancer, which meant repeated 
trips to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. It also meant a change of 
heart and mind; Rob dropped political science for a career in public health. 
&quot;He felt it a 
bit of a miracle. He was beating the cancer, but equally important, he had 
finally found his calling in life,&quot; says Rob's childhood friend, Gary Seligson. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Without any pre-med education, Rob Dobkin was accepted into the Yale University 
School of Medicine. He loved the university, loved that library. In May 1986, 
Rob received a master's degree in public health from Yale. According to his 
account of his medical condition, Rob was suffering 
&quot;systematic degeneration of various internal organs.&quot; His ailments included: corneal erosion; chronic urinary and testicular pain; 
prostate enlargement; night sweats; chills; and severe arm and leg pain. But 
nothing was wrong with his head or self-confidence. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In 1988, Rob applied to the University of California at San Francisco. He 
wanted a doctoral degree in nursing, but his application was rejected. 
&quot;Compared to the 
other applicants, he wasn't competitive,&quot; says Charlene Harrington, chairwoman of the Department of Sociology and 
Behavioral Science. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Rob Dobkin does not accept rejection well. He got a lawyer, and not just any 
lawyer. Civil rights attorney William Kunstler wrote the university on behalf 
of his friends, the Dobkins: 
&quot;I was moved to do so because, from every point of view, I felt that the 
rejection of his application was a tragic mistake.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The answer was still no. In Rob's resume, his career objective still read 
&quot;Formulating health care political theory and compassionate health policy to 
manage chronic disease.&quot; But the student still didn't have his doctoral degree, a virtual union card 
for work at the highest levels of laboratory research. Rob's professors from 
Yale mailed recommendations to the Johns Hopkins University: 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;He has one of the keener intellects I know,&quot; and 
&quot;He 
needs the opportunity to be creative with a minimum of orthodox academic 
restraints.&quot; And: 
&quot;Sometimes I get the feeling that he is a bit too concerned about failure,&quot; a professor wrote. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In 1990, Rob Dobkin was admitted to the Hopkins' School of Hygiene and Public 
Health. His new field was gerontology -- the study of aging. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">His academic adviser was Dr. Pearl German, a 69-year-old professor who has 
taught at Hopkins since 1972. Dr. German was offering a few students a National 
Institute of Aging traineeship for her Interdepartmental Gerontology Program. 
She had worked for years to get the grant for the university. Dr. German had 
one particular student in mind -- a bright young man from New Jersey. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Dr. German was very impressed with Rob Dobkin. After all, the man had been 
through so much medical turmoil. 
&quot;I 
thought his attitude and his experience would add up to a very committed 
student in gerontology,&quot; she said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Rob's tuition and medical insurance would be covered while at Hopkins. He would 
add the traineeship to his resume. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Dobkin at Hopkins 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Rob Dobkin tore through his course requirements in one year at Hopkins; 
students usually need two years. 
&quot;I wanted to accelerate quickly because I did not know how bad my medical 
problems would get,&quot; Rob said. The young man felt he was dying inside. And the longer he took, the 
more money he would have to pay back the federal government -- providers of his 
grant. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Rob had no interest in taking four or five years to get his doctoral degree. He 
planned to graduate in a record two or three years with a doctorate in public 
health and a gerontology certificate. But in 
Dr. Pearl German's experience, students typically need four years. Not this 
student, Rob says. Every time was crunch time for him. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In May 1991, Rob submitted his dissertation proposal. He wanted to study the 
accelerated aging of older people who have suffered the loss of a spouse. Rob 
says his faculty adviser, Dr. German, deliberately slowed his progress by 
making him re-write his proposal 11 times. She felt his early graduation would 
&quot;devalue&quot; the esteemed grant, Rob says. No, the student just wasn't ready, Dr. German 
says. 
&quot;If we had a seven-day wonder who could finish in two years, we'd be so proud 
we'd frame it.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The academic dispute was esoteric. Rob protested 
&quot;the cleansing of all empirical and bio-scientific methodology&quot; from his paper. Years later, Rob said, 
&quot;Marx, 
Marx, Marx . . . I didn't go to school to have Dr. German's academic agenda 
shoved down my throat.&quot; But in the opinion of Dr. German, 
&quot;The dissertation topic will be difficult to relate to issues central to health 
policy or gerontology in a meaningful and carefully reasoned way.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">It was decided that Rob needed another adviser. He met Dr. Arthur Freed on an 
elevator and pitched his case to him. Dr. Freed became Rob's adviser. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I think personality clashes were at the bottom of this,&quot; Dr. Freed says of the situation he inherited. 
&quot;To succeed, it's very important to get along with your adviser.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Rob had not won over the public health faculty. He could be a little 
intimidating; he wasn't afraid to tell faculty members they were wrong, Dr. 
Freed says. 
&quot;I do know Rob can alienate people.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In June, 
Rob sat for his oral exam before a panel that included Dr. Freed but not Dr. 
German. Rob failed, according to the majority opinion. The day after, Rob wrote 
to Hopkins professor Dr. George Rebok. 
&quot;Dr. Rebok, I did not know and was not prepared for models in health services 
research (choke, choke, strangle, choke) or Medicare/Medicaid stuff.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Rob wasn't the first student to fail his orals. Each student is entitled to 
retake the test; Rob was given three months to try again. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Then, on June 29, 1992, he was notified that Hopkins was recommending his 
traineeship be terminated. The advisory panel for gerontology, led by Dr. 
German, cited Rob's failure of the oral exam and 
&quot;serious gaps in your knowledge of fundamental health policy.&quot; Dr. Freed disagreed and said 
Rob's past performance suggested he could quickly fill in the gaps. Other grant 
students have failed their oral exam and re-taken it and retained their 
traineeships, Dr. Freed argued. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The government terminated Rob's traineeship July 31, 1992. Rob was still 
enrolled at Hopkins and still could pursue his doctoral degree. He would just 
have to pay his way -- nearly $ 18,000 a year in tuition. And he would have to 
re-group academically, according to the faculty. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;What everybody felt was that we had no right to use public money to help him 
fill in those gaps,&quot; Dr. German said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I was unwilling to pay tuition,&quot; Rob Dobkin said. 
&quot;Dammit, I earned that degree.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Rob,&quot; Dr. Freed said, 
&quot;lives and dies by his principles.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A man of letters 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Rob took a leave of absence from Hopkins in September 1992. The government 
wanted repayment of the 
traineeship, valued at $ 25,000 a year. Rob wanted the traineeship back. Losing 
the grant was stigmatizing his reputation and career, he argued. He wrote 
Health and Human Services, which wrote back: 
&quot;A decision to terminate a trainee is within the discretion of the program 
director.&quot; In other words, Dr. German. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Rob offered to settle the 
&quot;academic dispute.&quot; He would accept a master's degree from Hopkins. 
&quot;It is the School's position that Mr. Dobkin has not satisfied the requirements 
for a master's degree,&quot; said Estelle Fishbein, Hopkins' vice president and general counsel. 
&quot;It is important to note that . . . he failed to demonstrate the most basic and 
minimal knowledge of health policy.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">By 1993, the university had become wary of Robert Dobkin. Dr. German received 
harassing phone calls beginning in the summer. Her home phone would ring at 2 
a.m., and she would hear 
only breathing, Hopkins says. The calls prompted university officials to 
monitor Dr. German's phone. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Nothing but a smear campaign, Rob said. He claimed the university also spread 
rumors that he sexually harassed Dr. German. She says he came into her office 
once in 1993 wearing ragged, short shorts. Sitting in her office, he spread his 
legs and exposed his genitals, Dr. German says. 
&quot;I don't know whether it was inadvertent or purposeful,&quot; she has testified. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Based on Rob's phone records, Hopkins determined no calls were made to Dr. 
German from Rob's home. But the university's apprehension took another twist. 
Hopkins wondered whether Mr. Dobkin had any connection to the 
<strong>Unabomber.</strong> Believed to be responsible for 16 letter bombs nationwide, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> struck that June at Yale University, where a computer science professor was 
critically injured. 
Rob had attended Yale -- as have thousands of other students. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>Unabomber</strong> bulletins were posted throughout the Hopkins campus. University security 
instructed Dr. German to take extra precautions when leaving the building and 
when going to her car. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In New Jersey, Rob and his parents opened a letter-writing campaign. They wrote 
single-spaced, encyclopedic letters to public figures -- Bill and Hillary 
Clinton, Ross Perot, Bob Dole. Rob wrote his U.S. Congressman, the late Dean 
Gallo. Rob wrote the National Institutes of Health, the grant's underwriter. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Dobkin family's letters accused Dr. German of 
&quot;committing a felony by lying to the government,&quot; accused Hopkins of 
&quot;fraudulently&quot; administering the training grant, and accused Ms. Fishbein of 
&quot;covering-up&quot; the alleged fraud. In April 1993, Rob again called on William Kunstler -- 
defender of Jack Ruby, John 
Gotti, and Malcolm X's daughter. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Rob seemed like a loner to me, who was bucking the system. And like other 
loners, they struggle on with no let up. I kind of admire that,&quot; Mr. Kunstler says. The radical criminal attorney didn't accept the case 
because it was a civil action. But he hasn't forgotten Rob Dobkin. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Hell will freeze over before this guy will let go.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In July 1993, Ms. Fishbein obtained copies of the Dobkins' letters through the 
Freedom of Information Act. In a letter to Rob's Washington attorney, David 
Frulla, Ms. Fishbein said, 
&quot;You and your firm have a legal duty to warn any person . . . if any contact 
with your client leads to a reasonable belief that he is inclined to commit a 
violent act.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Nothing in those letters suggests violent 
behavior, and the Dobkins have the First Amendment right to petition their 
elected officials, said Mr. Frulla. 
&quot;In this case, you have simply labeled a dissident 'psychologically unstable,' 
&quot; he wrote Hopkins. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Hopkins was so apprehensive about Rob that it spent $ 1,125 for a private 
investigation. The investigator reported that Dobkin has no criminal 
convictions and had not bought any firearms. A Hopkins electronic message about 
the Dobkin investigation said, 
&quot;The issue with getting photos of him is that he does not emerge from his house. 
. . . There is concern that he fits the classic picture of someone who might 
'lose it' one day, especially if his legal recourses are denied.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Dobkin house in New Jersey was watched for 19 hours over three days. The 
July 21, 1993, surveillance included these highlights: 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">7 a.m. Arrived at the subject premises. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">8:47 a.m. The woman observed 
on previous surveillance and thought to be subject's mother, is seen exiting 
the garage. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">9:20 a.m. The woman is picking twigs, etc., from the property. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Nine days later, Rob Dobkin made his move. He says he had exhausted his options 
-- his lawyers had unsuccessfully petitioned the government to re-instate his 
traineeship. Rob felt he should sue. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I advised him he was crazy to go up against the university,&quot; Dr. Freed remembers. 
&quot;It's no-win.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">On July 30, 1993, Rob's attorneys filed a 182-paragraph civil suit against the 
Johns Hopkins University, Dr. Pearl German, Vice President Fishbein, two 
associate professors, one assistant professor, the National Institutes of 
Health and the National Institute on Aging. The thick suit was lined with 
allegations: 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Rob sued because he claims Hopkins gave him an invalid oral exam and broke a 
&quot;contract&quot; 
by not awarding him his degree. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Rob sued for defamation because he claims Hopkins told people he was 
psychologically unstable, that he cheated his way through Hopkins and Yale, and 
that he had sexually harassed Dr. German and threatened bodily harm against Ms. 
Fishbein. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Rob sued to get his traineeship back. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Rob sued for a master's degree in public health and a five-year extension to 
pay back the traineeship money. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Rob sued for $ 10.5 million. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The destruction of Mr. Dobkin's academic and personal reputation will not only 
haunt him throughout his life, but will prevent him from finishing his studies 
elsewhere,&quot; the lawsuit said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">To borrow Rob Dobkin's words, the only crime not alleged was arson. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Dobkin after Hopkins 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In 1994, Robert Dobkin was no longer a student at Johns Hopkins. He wanted 
public support and money for his cause. He got involved in the Asian Pacific 
American Heritage Festival in New York. The quiet, serious man would show up at 
the organizational meetings. He brought his own cause. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;It sounded like a fantastic story,&quot; says Cyril Nishimoto, director of Japanese American Social Services. 
&quot;On a gut feeling, I felt this connection to him.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mr. Nishimoto gave Rob $ 10,000 of his own money. 
&quot;God wanted me to give money to Rob's cause,&quot; says Mr. Nishimoto, 38. He believes it's a question of a powerful, 
deep-pocketed university out-manning and out-gunning one wronged guy. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Rob fished for lawyers. His lobbying was 
&quot;a one-sided sympathy and propaganda campaign,&quot; as Hopkins described it. Still, Rob tried to drop his case 
on the doorsteps of former Attorney General Ramsey Clark and former attorney 
general nominee Lani Guinier. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Rob's father, Donald Dobkin, had gone to City College with a man named Jeremiah 
Gutman, now a lawyer in New York City. 
&quot;I just thought justice was on their side,&quot; says Mr. Gutman, who agreed to help Rob without charge. Mr. Gutman enlisted 
Henry Kaufman of New York, whose specialty is the First Amendment. They were 
not, however, Rob's attorneys of record. He didn't have one and still doesn't. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">On Sept. 26, 1994, Johns Hopkins University sued Robert, Rosalyn and Donald 
Dobkin for defamation. The seven-page suit was to the point: 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Hopkins sued for defamation because the Dobkins wrote letters stating that Dr. 
German 
&quot;committed a felony by lying to the government&quot; and 
&quot;fraudulently&quot; 
administered the NIH grant. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Hopkins sued because Dr. German had subsequent grants denied by federal 
agencies. The university's business dealings had been hurt by the Dobkins' 
letters, Hopkins claimed. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Hopkins sued for $ 12 million. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;This is an example of how the legal system allows matters that really should 
not be in court to take up the time and energies of many people,&quot; says Frederick Savage, associate general counsel for Hopkins. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Henry Kaufman, the lawyer helping the Dobkins, contends that citizens have 
certain privileges when petitioning the government. 
&quot;By writing the letters, Rob's parents were exercising their prerogative of 
being parents.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">As for Hopkins' lawsuit, he says, 
&quot;A Goliath has pushed a David to the wall.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Matters of the mind 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Rob Dobkin mastered Yale on brains. He got into Hopkins on brains. All his 
life, Rob has relied on his mind. When he sued 
Johns Hopkins over an academic dispute, he planned to win the case based on the 
facts -- so clear and logical in his mind. Anybody with any sense would see he 
was right. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Rob Dobkin's mind would become the point of this case. Not in the way he 
planned, but in the way he tried to avoid. From now on, there would be little 
formal discussion about the academic dispute between Rob and Dr. Pearl German. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In a March 1994 hearing in Dobkin vs. Hopkins, the university requested more of 
Rob's medical records. The Dobkins argued that his physical or psychological 
condition was irrelevant; that the issues were academic due process and proper 
grant administration. Hopkins is illegally invading Rob's privacy and harassing 
him, the family said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">But Hopkins said Rob opened the question of his medical condition in his 
lawsuit by originally stating he wanted to 
finish school quickly out of fear his health problems could 
&quot;prevent him from his course of study and having a career.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Hopkins wonders how sick Rob Dobkin was or is. Whether he has been 
institutionalized or treated for depression could be important, too. Is he 
psychologically unbalanced? 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;That's what the case is about. That's what everybody's trying to prove,&quot; U.S. District Judge Clarence Goetz said at the hearing in Baltimore. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Rob resisted turning over more medical records, arguing that Hopkins had 
enough. In January, the court declared Rob's medical condition relevant and 
ordered him to undergo a mental examination. He did not. In March, he was given 
one last chance. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Failure to comply could lead to the dismissal of Dobkin's case,&quot; the court said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">This month, the court set a Nov. 6 trial date in Baltimore. Also this month, 
Rob Dobkin -- representing himself -- began discussing with an attorney for 
Hopkins the details of 
undergoing a mental examination. They haven't agreed on this issue. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">At the School of Hygiene and Public Health, Dr. Arthur Freed says if possible, 
Rob could continue his studies in his lab, where the student did solid work in 
1992. Rob still would make a very good doctoral candidate and a fine public 
health official, Dr. Freed says. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;If he's given the chance.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The meeting 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Finally, Rob Dobkin at first sight. In Jeremiah Gutman's Manhattan law office, 
Rob sits on a couch with his mother and father. He has brown hair worn in a 
pony tail, beautiful brown eyes, and he wears a black leather jacket and work 
boots. He looks like a brainy and thin biker. His parents look tired. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Until now, Rob has been glimpsed only in depositions, lawsuits and letters. 
In this meeting, he is thoroughly tense, defensive and sincere. The man's 
energy and anger can wear you out. The man can make you uneasy. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">So, how are you doing? 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Just keeping up with Jeff,&quot; Rob says. Jeff Ayers is Hopkins' attorney in the case. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">This whole thing is a mess. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;It's not a mess I made,&quot; Rob says. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">He looks good, and it looks as though that's the wrong thing to say. 
&quot;I look like I'm doing OK, but I'm in constant pain.&quot; He declines to have his picture taken for this story. He says Mr. Ayers might 
use the picture against him. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">As Rob retells his story of 
&quot;academic abuse,&quot; Donald and Rosalyn Dobkin try to add to his iron narrative. He interrupts 
them. The family's cause is shredding the family's patience. He scolds them for 
referring to his medical history. 
&quot;Depression isn't a 
crime,&quot; his mother says. We must stick to the point, Rob demands. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">What was the point? Rob's father remembers looking up 
&quot;fraud&quot; in Webster's and using the word in their 1993 letters to describe Hopkins' 
actions. In retrospect, Mr. Kaufman would have recommended against that 
language. 
&quot;For God's sake, don't sue,&quot; Mr. Gutman would have also advised. But they weren't advising the Dobkins 
then. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">What was the academic dispute between Rob and Dr. German? Something about Marx. 
Something about Rob's interest in bio-gerontology and 
&quot;freezing time.&quot; Something about his success 
&quot;devaluing&quot; her prized program. Something almost forgotten. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Rob spends his afternoons here, gorging himself on Mr. Gutman's law books. 
Rob's parents wanted him to be a lawyer. The prospect makes him smile, a 
wonderful smile that doesn't get out much. 
&quot;I would go to law school because 
it's a fixed time,&quot; Rob says. No faculty members imposing their academic agenda. Three years and 
out. Rob will forever feel pressed for time. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">He doesn't work. His goal was to be a laboratory scientist for the National 
Institutes of Health. But he still doesn't have a doctoral degree. Surely there 
must be jobs for people with a master's degree from Yale. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I don't relish the option of seeking work knowing my personal integrity has 
been impugned,&quot; says Rob. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">He says he's broke, ruined and virtually friendless because of Hopkins. 
&quot;My norm is not having a normal or happy life.&quot; Devotedly listening, as always, his 66-year-old mother winces. Tears dangle in 
her eyes. 
&quot;He was a happy, wonderful, delicious child,&quot; she says. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Rob, what does your heart treasure? 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;To have their golden years returned,&quot; he says, realizing 
a 37-year-old man with three degrees shouldn't be living at home. He should be 
on his own, married with children. But it was a family decision to spend the 
malpractice money and all this time on the cause. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I am resolute and determined to have my name cleared,&quot; Rob Dobkin says. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">And those are his final words. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">'Enough already' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Robert Dobkin's 72-year-old father palms a frayed New Yorker cartoon. A 
kneeling man is pictured at his bed, and the caption reads: 
&quot;Please Lord, enough already.&quot; Donald Dobkin, the former infantryman, looks ready to surrender. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I think everything is already lost,&quot; he says. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Henry Kaufman also considers the prospect of Rob losing his case. 
&quot;A family that litigates together,&quot; he begins . . . 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Perishes together,&quot; Rob's father finishes.
