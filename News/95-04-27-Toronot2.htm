</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong> 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">TIMOTHY McVeigh says he is a political prisoner. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Shackled in the jail cell where he is facing questions about his alleged role 
in the Oklahoma city bombing, the one-time U.S. Army sergeant refuses to 
disclose anything more than his 
&quot;name, rank and serial number.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Meanwhile, America's infamous 
&quot;<strong>Unabomber,</strong>&quot; whose latest package of deadly explosives - his 16th mail bomb in 17 years - 
killed a forestry lobbyist in Sacramento last week, asserts in a public letter 
&quot;the right to engage in sabotage&quot; for a political cause. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Americans, who once found it easy to distinguish between domestic criminals and 
foreign terrorists, are finding this difficult to digest.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Political crime is supposed to be something that happens in other places. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">This is not precisely true. During the 1960s, militant fringe groups engaged in 
their own version of violent debate with the U.S. 
&quot;establishment.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">From the assassination of John Kennedy to the kidnapping of Patty Hearst, 
political violence (to paraphrase former Black Panther H. Rap Brown) is 
&quot;as American as apple pie.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">All the same, there is a qualitative difference in the menace stalking 
America's towns and cities today. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The highly organized and well-armed militias of the right appeal to a much 
larger and more determined audience than their left-wing counterparts ever did. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Fuelled by a national concern about America's declining influence in the world 
and about the 
&quot;softening&quot; of American values, these groups are camouflaged by the country's mainstream. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">They can blend easily into the church hall and drugstore culture of Middle 
America because they embody, 
in a twisted way, the deepest fears of millions of their compatriots. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">That may be one reason why President Bill Clinton's pledge to strengthen the 
powers of law enforcement agencies against terrorism has struck such a powerful 
chord. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A majority of Americans supports proposals made by Clinton this week that would 
give federal agents power to monitor telephone calls and check the personal 
records of anyone 
&quot;suspected&quot; of involvement with terrorism. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Some would call it a perfect example of cutting off one's nose to spite the 
face. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">But ultra-conservative politicians and their constituencies appear to believe 
only the most radical surgery will eliminate the connections people might make 
between their own rhetoric and the fanatics who have taken up arms in their 
name. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bitter reaction of conservative talk radio hosts across America to 
Clinton's suggestion that they have helped to create the 
climate for Oklahoma city is a case in point. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">They are at least being oddly consistent. The same people applauded the 
crackdown on U.S. left-wing groups in the 1960s, when the FBI collected 
information on thousands of innocent people. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The controversy stirred up by that assault on civil liberties was the principal 
reason why the powers of federal agencies were sharply curtailed by American 
governments since. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Now once again a small minority of Americans is warning against Clinton's 
measures and his plan to enact an 
&quot;omnibus anti-terrorism&quot; law. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Our fundamental liberties are never more in danger than after incidents such as 
(Oklahoma city),&quot; said Philip Gustis of the American Civil Liberties Union. 
&quot;We must guard against overreacting.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Unfortunately, overreaction is the norm around the world. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Canada's actions during the FLQ crisis provide 
one example of how countries have found it difficult to strike a balance 
between protecting civil liberties and smashing terrorism. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">This was a simple problem compared to today's high-tech environment, in which 
terrorists enjoy easy access to means of destruction and the methods of 
delivering them. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Transnational&quot; criminal cartels are the globe's newest entrepreneurs, transcending borders 
and arousing calls for a harsh legal response. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Yet law enforcement authorities often admit privately they already have 
sufficient intelligence and legal means to counter these new threats to 
international stability. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">What usually is lacking is the will to co-operate and share information among 
often competing agencies. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">And the political courage to isolate the groups even when, as America is 
discovering, they come from the heartland. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The horror of Oklahoma city has plunged the United States into a crucial debate 
over redefining democracy. It will be closely 
watched around the world.
