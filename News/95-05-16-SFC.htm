<strong>Unabomber</strong> 

 They say movement prefers words, rarely uses violence 



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> Michael Taylor, Chronicle Staff Writer 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The nondescript packages seemed innocent enough as they drifted through the 
mail stream and surfaced in the homes of important people around the United 
States. Then one box exploded, tearing off a woman's hands.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Several more packages were discovered at a post office by a suspicious clerk 
who found that they all contained sticks of dynamite wired to explode when the 
boxes were unwrapped. More bombs were discovered on doorsteps, and one killed a 
security guard who got too close.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">It sounds like the work of the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> an elusive anti-technology anarchist whose devices have killed three people 
and injured 23 others during the past 17 years. But, in fact, the bombs were 
created by a group of radical anarchists back in 1919, when anarchism in 
America was in its heyday.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">And now the UNABOM case has uncomfortably and sharply brought back those 
memories from nearly a century ago and focused attention on a movement that 
still survives, albeit far from the political mainstream.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The small segment of people in America who call themselves anarchists -- fewer 
than 5,000 by one estimate -- find that they are in a sometimes unwelcome 
spotlight, courtesy of the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> a man who until a few weeks ago might have been dubbed the Bashful Bomber but 
is now mailing out 
windy explanations for his acts.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He gets his letters into the New York Times and promises even lengthier tracts 
on why he has spent years killing, maiming and, in general, raising hell with 
his mail bombs and other explosive devices.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The fact that the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> has received so much publicity disturbs the anarchism community, a scholarly 
bunch that eschews the idea of bombing opponents into submission and carefully 
points out that violence has always been an infrequently used weapon in the 
anarchist's arsenal.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In short, experts say and history shows, most anarchists prefer words to war, 
bombast to bombs.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''When I first saw a couple of phrases in (the 
<strong>Unabomber's)</strong> letter, I was amazed,'' said Oregon writer John Zerzan, a vocal anarchist 
critic of modern technology. ''Here I've been, laboring in the wilderness and 
publishing things for years. And then this comes 
along. It's ironic -- the newspapers wouldn't be up talking to me if (the 
<strong>Unabomber)</strong> hadn't been blowing people up. I'm just struck that these ideas are getting 
out.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Zerzan, like others interviewed for this article, says immediately that he does 
not ''take responsibility for (the 
<strong>Unabomber's)</strong> actions.'' But Zerzan endorses the ideas put forth by the bomber in his letter 
to the New York Times.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 1,300-word letter, identifying the writer as a member of ''the terrorist 
group FC,'' detailed the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> anti-technology and anarchistic ideas and demanded that the Times or a news 
magazine print the bomber's longer tract, an article of up to 37,000 words that 
presumably would further his views.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The letter arrived in New York the same day a mail bomb arrived in Sacramento 
and killed a timber industry lobbyist.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bomb and the letter garnered so 
much attention that in some newspapers, particularly in California, the 
Oklahoma City bombing was kicked to the bottom of the front page, no mean feat 
considering the unparallelled devastation in Oklahoma City.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Some anarchists are fed up with this UNABOM interloper, this 
anarchist-come-lately.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Under the headline, ''Unabummer,'' a Berkeley anarchist newspaper called 
''Slingshot'' recently printed a front page editorial that began, ''Dear Mr.  
<strong>Unabomber:</strong> Thanks a lot, a--hole.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The paper then took the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> to task for being politically incorrect: ''Package bombs are generally an 
especially poor form of direct action. There is no way of assuming they reach a 
particular target rather than some working class secretary who happens to be 
opening the mail that day.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''Besides, package bombs against a handful of scientists and business people 
can't build any kind of change.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the letter to the Times, FC's self-described terrorist -- dubbed the UNABOM 
killer because many of his targets have been either airlines or 
university-related people -- rails specifically against ''scientists and 
engineers, especially in critical fields like computers and genetics,'' and 
says ''we call ourselves anarchists because we would like, ideally, to break 
down all society into very small, completely autonomous units.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''The more high-tech society becomes, the more it tends to flatten real 
experience,'' Zerzan agrees. ''People sit in front of a screen, and life 
becomes emptier and emptier.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Zerzan said that all this anti- technology fervor started with the Luddites, a 
group of skilled textile workers in early 19th century England who were thrown 
out of work by the first wave of the Industrial Revolution as huge looms and 
other machinery, coupled with regular schedules, produced a far more rigid and, 
Zerzan says, dehumanizing control of society.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Toward the end of the 19th century, anarchism in America became synonymous with 
large labor syndicates, giving rise to the politically charged label 
''anarchosyndicalists'' (spinning off the word syndicat, which is French for 
trade union), and soon their ideas began moving from back rooms to front pages, 
particularly when bombs or bullets were involved.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">This reputation for violence reached its zenith when anarchist Leon Czolgosz 
assassinated President William McKinley at the Pan- American Exposition in 
Buffalo, N.Y., in September 1901.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''Such acts of terrorism did much to establish an image of the bearded, 
bomb-throwing anarchist in the minds of generations of newspaper readers,'' 
said one encyclopedia account of anarchism. ''In fact, however, most adherents 
of anarchism were 
never terrorists.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Paul Avrich, a historian at Queens College in New York who has written 
extensively about anarchism, said the parallels between turn-of-the-century 
anarchists and today's 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> and, for that matter, the militia groups making headlines in the wake of the 
Oklahoma City bombing, are eerie.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In 1919, Avrich says, the Galleani Group of Italian anarchists, angry with new 
federal laws allowing government agents to summarily deport anarchists and 
close down such leading anarchist newspapers as the Subversive Chronicle 
(Cronaca Sovversiva), mailed bombs to senators and other well- known federal 
officers. One person was killed and another injured.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But soon after the failed bomb campaign, a member of the anarchist group ''took 
a horse and wagon -- they didn't have Ryder trucks in those days -- filled it 
with dynamite and parked 
it across the street from (banking house) J.P. Morgan 
&amp; Co. on Wall Street, right in the heart of capitalism as an anarchist might see 
it,'' Avrich says.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bomb went off at noon sharp.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''The 33 people who were killed and the 200 people who were injured were not 
well-to-do brokers,'' Avrich said. ''They were mostly runners and secretaries.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">That was the last of the big anarchist bombings.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Until now.
