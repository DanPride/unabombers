<strong>UNABOMBER</strong> BEGINS TO EMERGE;
TERRORISM: EXPERTS EXAMINE LETTERS TO DRAW A PROFILE OF THE SERIAL BOMBER. SOME 
SUGGEST HE WAS THWARTED IN A SCIENCE OR COMPUTER JOB AND IS SEEKING REVENGE.  



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> By DAN MORAIN and JENIFER WARREN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>DATELINE:</strong> SACRAMENTO 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The enigma known as the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> has become more complex, even as the terrorist tried to explain his motives in 
a letter that reached millions.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In a taunting and mocking letter to one of his victims, and another to the New 
York Times, the serial bomber uses phrases from radical environmentalists, 
suggesting he fancies himself an environmentalist who yearns for a sort of 
&quot;ecotopia&quot; in which there are no computers or high technology. Yet he misspells 
<em>Sierra.</em>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He writes that he seeks the 
&quot;destruction of the worldwide industrial system&quot; as a 
&quot;more immediate goal.&quot; But in the same line, the writer says the goal will not be reached for several 
decades. Most ominously, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> decries technology while threatening to build more sophisticated and powerful 
bombs.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In all, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> mailed four letters last Thursday, including one published in the New York 
Times on Wednesday and another sent to Yale computer sciences professor David 
Gelernter, a victim of a 1993 Unabom attack. Jim R. Freeman, the FBI agent in 
charge of the Unabom investigation, did not release the other two or say to 
whom they were addressed.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Taken together, the letters are certain to provide new clues, and may cause the 
FBI to re-evaluate some theories about the serial bomber, who is believed to be 
responsible for 16 attacks that have killed three men and injured 23 during the 
past 17 years.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">On Wednesday, FBI agents finished gathering evidence at the Sacramento offices 
of the California Forestry Assn., where the latest Unabom attack on Monday 
killed executive Gilbert Murray. 
Murray's co-workers were allowed back in the building to collect their 
belongings, but the FBI appeared no closer to solving the case.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;We're looking for a piece of luck, the tip from the public that will solve this 
case,&quot; Freeman said at a San Francisco press conference.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Though the case remains a mystery, the letters -- the most lengthy 
communications since the attacks began in 1978 -- are certain to assist 
investigators, said Steve Higgins, former director of the federal Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Through all these long years, law enforcement hasn't learned much about him 
other than his very distinctive signature in making the bombs,&quot; said Higgins, who retired in 1993. 
&quot;Any time you get this much information, it's got to be helpful. Even if the 
information isn't true, the more you learn about somebody -- the 
way he writes, his thought process -- the more you know.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the past, the bomber was said to have had a high school education. But the 
letters are articulate, suggesting the writer had more education. In interviews 
with the Los Angeles Times, experts in psychology, psychiatry and terrorism 
speculated Wednesday that the bomber may be striking back at researchers out of 
rage over some past failure in their world.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Based on a reading of the New York Times letter, the bomber, though clearly of 
above-average intelligence, possesses a 
&quot;remarkable naivete,&quot; said Reid Meloy, a forensic psychologist in San Diego.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The letter is incredibly grandiose,&quot; Meloy said. 
&quot;It's amazing that he believes that through these isolated acts of bombing, he 
could actually destabilize and destroy worldwide industry.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the letter to Gelernter, released by the FBI on Wednesday, the writer 
derided the professor as a 
&quot;techno-nerd,&quot; and takes issue with a 1991 book about computers, 
&quot;Mirror World,&quot; that Gelernter wrote.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;If you'd had any brains,&quot; the letter said, 
&quot;you would have realized that there are a lot of people out there who resent 
bitterly the way techno-nerds like you are changing the world.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Citing the book, the letter says: 
&quot;You tried to justify your research by claiming that the developments you 
describe are inevitable, and that any college person can learn enough about 
computers to compete in a computer-dominated world. Apparently, people without 
a college degree don't count.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;They are inevitable only because techno-nerds like you make them inevitable. If 
you claim you are justified in pursuing your research because the developments 
involved are inevitable, then you may as well say that theft is inevitable, 
therefore we shouldn't blame thieves. But we do not believe that progress and 
growth are inevitable. 
We'll have more to say about that later.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In various places, 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> writes about what he hopes to accomplish -- 
&quot;promote social instability in industrial society, propagate anti-industrial 
ideas and give encouragement to those who hate the industrial system.&quot; Such visions conjure up writings about utopian world views.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;It's rather clear that what he's talking about relates to a beneficent movement 
that is sometimes called communitarianism,&quot; said Charles Bahn, a professor of psychology at John Jay College of Criminal 
Justice in New York. 
&quot;The idea is a return to a strong sense of community, where behavior is pursued 
for the good of community, not just the individual.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Communitarianism is a movement that aims 
&quot;to shore up the social, moral and political foundations of society&quot; by rallying people around a core of common ethical values, its leading 
guru, sociologist Amitai Etzioni, has written.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Etzioni's brand of communitarianism is harmless. But critics say there is 
another side to the movement that includes white supremacists and others who 
are battling government encroachment and intrusions on personal liberties such 
as the right to bear arms.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Throughout his 17 years, 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> targets have been diffuse: Northwestern University, American Airlines, a 
computer rental store owner, a professor of computer sciences, a professor of 
genetics, a Burson-Marsteller advertising executive and -- most recently -- the 
forestry lobbyist.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In some instances, the bombs are misdirected. 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> claimed that he targeted Thomas Mosser, the advertising executive who was 
killed in December, because the firm 
&quot;helped Exxon clean up its public image after the Exxon Valdez&quot; oil spill. Mosser never worked on the spill. Murray, the latest victim, was 
not the intended target. His 
predecessor was.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;This is a guy who aspired to a career in a scientific or computer-related field 
and then experienced thwarted ambition early on,&quot; said Michael Rustigan, a professor of criminology at San Francisco State 
University.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Through the years, Rustigan speculated, his 
&quot;personal grudge evolved and he began to see himself as part of a campaign to 
stop these corporate capitalists who are killing trees, wrecking the 
environment and manipulating the world.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;He has all the classic traits of a missionary serial killer, meaning a killer 
who is on a mission, a crusade, who is a self-appointed reformer with active 
malice,&quot; Rustigan said. The 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> claim to be part of a group called 
&quot;FC,&quot; he added, shows his belief that he has 
&quot;a community of support&quot; for his actions.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">William Vicary, a clinical professor of psychiatry at USC, 
agreed that the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> goals, as outlined in the letter, reflect a person 
&quot;who has had difficulties in his life and is blaming others.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;If he feels he's been treated unfairly and has been discarded as a piece of 
garbage by society, then one way for him to feel better would be to destroy the 
forces in society,&quot; Vicary said. 
&quot;So everybody would be a rugged individual again. Each man would be a king of 
his own little territory.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Vicary, like other psychologists, say the 
&quot;central feature&quot; of the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> psychology is paranoia. As Vicary put it: 
&quot;He's striking out at these adversaries and foes that don't seem to be realistic 
threats to him.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Several experts said the decision by the New York Times and other publications 
to publish his letter will feed his delusions, and perhaps encourage him to 
attack again so he would gain more attention.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;This is a man who loves the attention he's getting,&quot; said 
James Fox, dean of the College of Criminal Justice at Northeastern University. 
&quot;Want to solve this case? Then find someone who bought 50 copies of the New York 
Times today. You'd have your killer.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the letters, 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> claims to be part of a group called 
&quot;FC,&quot; and uses 
<em>we</em> when referring to his cause. But Freeman of the FBI remains convinced that 
agents are looking for only one person, and said, 
&quot;We don't have a shred of evidence that he is connected with other people.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> did offer authorities one ray of hope in the letter, noting that he is getting 
tired of spending his evenings and weekends making bombs.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Maybe he's getting older,&quot; said Vicary. 
&quot;It's a lot of work. It's exciting, but it's anxiety provoking. Maybe he's worn 
out.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Does that mean he's going to abandon his deadly pursuit? Don't count on it.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Very few 
serial killers quit,&quot; said Rustigan. 
&quot;Once they have a celebrity career, once they have a name like 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> once they're hooked on the fame, it's very difficult for them to stop cold 
turkey. This guy's pumped.&quot;
