</p><p class="body" align="Left">FBI agents searching Theodore Kaczynski's cabin found addresses of corporate 
executives, maps of San Francisco, bus schedules, firearms and anti-depressant 
medicine, an inventory made public Monday shows. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In a filing disclosed in federal court, the FBI also confirmed published 
reports of three typewriters found in the cabin, as well as several unspecified 
documents and notes. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Although Kaczynski is suspected of being the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> none of the documents was identified as the original text of the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> manifesto, the 35,000-word tract published in The Washington Post and The New 
York Times last year. A source said last week that agents had found what 
appeared to be the original of the manifesto, a diatribe against modern 
technology.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Kaczynski, 53, was arrested at the cabin near Lincoln, Mont., two weeks ago and 
is being held on charges of possessing bomb components. He has not been charged 
with any of the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> attacks, which killed three people and injured 23 over 17 years. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In its list made public Monday, the FBI did not specifically link any of the 
more than 600 items to the 
<strong>Unabomber.</strong> 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The list does not 
<strong>identify</strong> the corporate executives or list the addresses. The references to San 
Francisco and to corporate executives were cryptic. The item was listed as: 
&quot;One 'Aldrich' box containing misc. papers, newspaper clippings, bus schedule, 
addresses of corporate officials and maps of San Francisco.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The references may be significant because the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> who raged against modern technology, targeted executives. Three of the 
bombings occurred in the San Francisco Bay area and two in Sacramento, Calif. 
Five of the 
bombs were mailed from Northern California, including two from Oakland and one 
from San Francisco. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A bottle of Trazadone, a prescription anti-depressant drug, was found. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">One item simply read: 
&quot;One 'Calumet Baking Powder' can containing soldering wire.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Another specified a pair of brown and green hiking boots with a brand name, 
Northwest Territory. One entry said 
&quot;letters.&quot; Another read 
&quot;documents.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Chemicals On List 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Authorities also found a pipe bomb and an 
&quot;improvised explosive device&quot; in a cardboard box, as well as five firearms - a rifle and four handguns. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The list also described a hooded jacket, a blue zippered sweat shirt and hood 
and two pairs of plastic glasses. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A 
<strong>witness</strong> who saw the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> plant one bomb described him as wearing a 
hooded sweat shirt and aviator glasses, resulting in the widely circulated 
composite sketch. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Among the chemicals listed in the inventory were saltpeter, ammonium nitrate, 
abietic acid, ground aluminum, manganese dioxide, boric acid, ammonium alum, a 
copper compound, lye, lead acetate, lead hydroxide and lead carbonate. Those 
were in jars labeled by Kaczynski in his handwriting. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Authorities found other, unlabeled jars containing various types of powder. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Agents also listed 232 books, some of which may provide insight into 
Kaczynski's thoughts, such as 
&quot;Eastern Mysticism,&quot; 
&quot;Asimov's Guide to the Bible,&quot; 
&quot;Holy Bible Dictionary Concordance,&quot; 
&quot;Comes the Comrade,&quot; 
&quot;Les Miserables&quot; and 
&quot;Growing Up Foolish.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Everything seized from the cabin has been trucked to FBI headquarters in 
Quantico, Va., where it is undergoing microscopic examination. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI list was ordered released by U.S. 
District Judge Charles Lovell, who authorized the original search.
