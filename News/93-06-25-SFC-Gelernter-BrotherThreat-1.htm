</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A world renowned computer scientist was seriously injured yesterday when a 
mail bomb exploded at Yale University, a day after a similar blast injured a 
distinguished University of California at San Francisco genetics professor at 
his home in Tiburon.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI is looking for a connection between the two bombings and also is 
investigating possible links between the Tiburon bomb and the unsolved case of 
a dozen mail bombs, some that were sent to university researchers, between 1978 
and 1987.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Tiburon case has ''similar forensic characters'' to the dozen bombings that 
killed one person and injured 21 across the nation, said Rick Smith, the FBI 
spokesman in San Francisco. He would not elaborate.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">FBI Director William Sessions, at a news conference in San Francisco, said the 
FBI is sending computer notices to universities across the country urging 
caution when opening packages.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He urged academics to be on the lookout for packages with oily stains, emitting 
strange odors, protruding wires or markings such as ''personal'' or 
''confidential'' and bearing unfamiliar return addresses or illegible 
handwriting. All, he said, are telltale signs of a mail bomb.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">David Gelernter, 38, a Yale assistant professor, was critically injured when he 
opened a package in his fifth-floor office at Arthur K. Watson Hall, the 
university computer science center. He suffered wounds to his abdomen, chest, 
face and hands and underwent surgery at Yale-New Haven Hospital.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">UCSF's Dr. Charles Epstein, a highly regarded geneticist whose research has 
contributed to 
understanding mental retardation, remained in stable condition yesterday at 
Marin County General Hospital.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 59-year-old scientist opened a padded brown envelope at the kitchen table 
of his Tiburon home Tuesday afternoon. A bomb, apparently designed to detonate 
when the envelope was opened, exploded. FBI authorities said he lost three 
fingers on his right hand and suffered abdominal injuries and a broken right 
arm.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Gelernter is the author of a computer language called Linda that gives personal 
computers more power. He has written widely on computer issues.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Late yesterday afternoon, Gelernter's brother, Joel, a psychiatrist and 
geneticist, received a telephone threat at the Veterans Administration Hospital 
in West Haven, Conn. The caller told the woman who answered the phone ''You are 
next,'' referring to Joel 
Gelernter. Joel Gelernter is also a Yale professor.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">VA authorities searched his mail but did not find a bomb.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The investigation into the earlier attacks was code named 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> because at least five universities were among the targets. Two blasts occurred 
at the University of California at Berkeley, in 1982 and 1985.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The only reported fatality came in 1985, when the owner of a Sacramento 
computer store was killed when a parcel delivered to his store exploded.  
Another attack was directed at the president of United Airlines.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In addition to the bombings at UC Berkeley, mail bombs in the 1980s went off at 
Northwestern University in Chicago, Vanderbilt University in Nashville, the 
University of Utah in Salt Lake City and the University of Michigan in Ann 
Arbor.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">One bomb that was defused at the Boeing Corp.ration in Auburn, Washington, had been mailed from Oakland.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the wake of the bombing, universities around the state yesterday urged mail 
sorting staff and others to exercise care when opening packages. Many are 
coordinating their activities with local police departments responsible for 
responding to bomb emergencies.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''We were alarmed at the two events involving UCSF and Yale professors, and 
because of that we have given our mail division and our receiving division 
notice to be alert to any suspicious packages,'' said Bob Sanders, a UC 
Berkeley spokesman. Sanders said the university was already taking precautions 
because of the earlier attacks on the campus.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Sessions said the investigations into the Yale and Tiburon bombings could take 
a long time. He drew comparisons to the bomb that killed an Alabama judge in 
1989 that eventually led to the bomber's capture.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''It was very careful, detail by detail, on every single facet of 
both the composition of the bomb (and) hundreds of thousands of records,'' 
Sessions said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The New Haven and Tiburon explosions are being investigated by agents from the 
FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and postal inspectors.  Officials 
are reluctant to conclude that the events are related.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''I don't think any of us are willing to say conclusively that this is part of 
the same bombing,'' said Daniel Mahelko, chief spokesman for the U.S. Postal 
Inspection Service, the post office's law enforcement arm. ''To confirm that 
there is any connection would be premature.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">However, officials suggested that the kind of devices detonated at Yale and 
Tiburon are similar to those used in a string of bombings that mysteriously 
ceased in 1987. At the time, authorities speculated that the serial bomber was 
a disgruntled academic or student, an angry airline employee or someone whose 
job was displaced by a computer.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Both Berkeley bomb blasts 
went off in Cory Hall, the campus' main engineering building. In 1982, a 
professor of electrical engineering was seriously hurt but eventually recovered 
from his injuries. In 1985, a graduate student received serious injuries when 
he opened a plastic box containing the bomb.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Postal officials said they thought that all the attacks were the work of the 
same person because the detonation devices were similar. They would not reveal 
details about the devices, but the explosives in the 1985 Berkeley incident 
were encased in a plastic box three inches high by six inches wide.  The 1982 
device consisted of a rectangular metal container with explosives and flammable 
liquid.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Although the letter bombs have led universities to be more security conscious, 
postal authorities said letter bombs remain rare.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">They said that between 1981 and 1993, 190 
explosive devices were sent through the mail. Of those, 67 exploded, resulting 
in 57 injuries and nine deaths. Seventy of the incidents resulted in arrests.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The post office's Mahelko cautioned against undue alarm to the bomb attacks on 
the UCSF and Yale professors. He said that of 160 billion pieces of mail 
handled by the Postal Service last year, 10 mail bombs were discovered, 
resulting in four injuries and one death.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''The chances of getting a mail bomb are very, very remote considering the 
billions of pieces of mail we handle each year,'' Mahelko said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In addition, Mahelko said that last year, there were 435 incidents in which 
devices such as pipe bombs were placed by hand in mail boxes or other mail 
receptacles but not actually delivered through by mail. Almost 300 of those 
went off, but 
only five people were injured.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He said it is not necessary for people to take special precautions, unless they 
feel they might be targets. ''Unless we can put some link between the Tiburon 
and New Haven cases, there aren't any special precautions that need to be 
taken,'' he said.
