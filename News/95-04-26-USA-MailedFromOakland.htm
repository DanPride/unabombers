</p><p class="body" align="Left">A serial bomber who added to a brazen 17-year reign of terror with a fatal 
blast at a timber lobbying group here was inspired by the Oklahoma City 
bombing, experts said Tuesday.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;It does hurt his feelings when other bombings occur,&quot; said Lawrence Myers, who is writing a book on serial bombers. 
&quot;If he can get (Oklahoma suspect) John Doe 2 off the front page and his 
composite picture back on, he'd be very, very happy.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Authorities disclosed they'd received new insight into the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> thinking because of three letters mailed from Oakland along with the parcel 
that arrived at the California Forestry Association's office Monday.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Although authorities have released a sketch of a single suspect, letters 
claimed the bombings were the work of a group. In the letters to some victims 
and The New York Times, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> offers to stop bombings - if major print media publish a 37,000-word article.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;If the answer is unsatisfactory, we will start building our next bomb,&quot; the letter warns.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The timber group's president, Gilbert Murray, 47, died instantly after opening 
the meticulously wrapped package.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bomber is 
&quot;describing his actions and motives for the first time in 17 years,&quot; said the FBI's Jim Freeman, who heads the federal task force that offers a $ 1 
million reward.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The letter to the Times says the bomber's group wants 
&quot;the destruction of the worldwide industrial system. Through our bombings we 
hope to promote social instability in industrial society, propagate anti-industrial ideas and give encouragement to those who hate the industrial system.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A similar letter to the Times coincided with an attack that killed a New Jersey 
ad executive last year. That letter aped a communique to the Times from the 
Trade Center bombers, another reason to suspect that press clippings motivate 
the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> Myers said. 
&quot;Most of us were watching the Oklahoma bombing identifying with the victims. He 
would have been more likely to identify with the perpetrators.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The suspect has set off at least 16 bombs since 1978, killing three, including 
one other Sacramento man, and injuring 23.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> - so named because early attacks targeted university and airline officials - 
has used a puzzling scatter-shot pattern.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The suspect has a penchant for wood, both in the construction of his devices 
and in his targets. Many victims had wood or wood-associated 
words in names or addresses.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">FBI profilers have pegged the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> as a loner in his 40s, perhaps with a home shop where he hand-tools his bombs.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Even box hinges are hand-crafted. 
&quot;He's had bombs that look like a book, a notebook, a can of paint,&quot; said expert Murray Miron.

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> LETTER EXCERPTS
</p><p class="body" align="Left">-- We would not want anyone to think that we have any desire to hurt professors 
who study archaeology, history, literature or harmless stuff like that. The 
people we are out to get are the scientists and engineers . . . in critical 
fields like computers and genetics.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">-- The FBI has tried to portray these bombings as the work of an isolated nut. 
We won't waste our time arguing about whether we are nuts, but we certainly are 
not isolated. For security reasons we won't reveal the number of members of our 
group, but anyone who will 
read the anarchist and radical environmentalist journals will see that 
opposition to the industrial-technological system is widespread and growing.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">-- Clearly we are in a position to do a great deal of damage. And it doesn't 
appear that the FBI is going to catch us any time soon. The FBI is a joke.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">-- The people who are pushing all this growth and progress garbage deserve to 
be severely punished. But our goal is less to punish them than to propagate 
ideas.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">-- Anyhow we are getting tired of making bombs. It's no fun having to spend all 
your evenings and weekends preparing dangerous mixtures, filing trigger 
mechanisms out of scraps of metal or searching the sierras for a place isolated 
enough to test a bomb.
