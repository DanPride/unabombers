<strong>Unabomber</strong> letter ridicules victim, calls him 'dumb'

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> taunted one of his injured victims for opening a mysterious package that blew 
up, calling him a 
&quot;techno-nerd&quot; in a letter released Wednesday. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The text of the letter to Yale computer science professor David Gelernter was 
distributed by the FBI the day after another letter from the elusive bomber was 
published by The New York Times. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;People with advanced degrees aren't as smart as they think they are,&quot; the letter to Gelernter said. 
&quot;If you'd had any brains you would have realized that there are a lot of people 
out there who resent bitterly the way techno-nerds like you are changing the 
world and you wouldn't have been dumb enough to open an unexpected package from 
an unknown source.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Gelernter was badly injured when a mail bomb exploded in his office June 24, 
1993. He needed extensive surgery on his right hand and also was injured on his 
abdomen, chest and face. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The letter was one of four mailed the same day as the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> latest package, which killed a timber industry lobbyist Monday in Sacramento, 
Calif. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">-NO MORE EMISSIONS: Lawmakers in Maine voted to repeal the nation's first 
comprehensive auto emissions testing program and let the state take its chances 
in court. Gov. Angus King plans to sign the measure into law today, said his 
spokesman, Dennis Bailey. The bill passed in the state House 137-6 and in the 
Senate 29-0. Lawmakers approved the program with little fanfare in 1992 to 
comply with the federal Clean Air Act of 1990, which requires states to impose 
stringent tailpipe tests in smoggy areas. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">-WELCOME TO THE CLUB: A woman used The Club to club a would-be thief. Robin Van 
Bortle was attaching the anti-theft device to her steering wheel Monday in 
suburban Rochester, N.Y., when a man tried to force his way into the car, 
police said. 
&quot;I wasn't going to let him in,&quot; the 32-year-old woman said. 
&quot;He opened up my door as I was putting in my Club and (I) just started to hit 
him with it.&quot; As the man ran away, Van Bortle and passers-by chased him down. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">-REKINDLED DEBATE: New research contends that teenagers start on low- nicotine 
snuff and graduate to stronger brands that, because of gradual chemical changes 
in the recipe, may release more nicotine into the bloodstream. The studies, 
published in the journal Tobacco Control, 
promise to rekindle the debate over whether tobacco companies manipulate 
nicotine levels to make their products more addictive.

off a Colorado mountain near Pikes Peak a day after an avalanche and high winds 
stranded them and killed one man.
