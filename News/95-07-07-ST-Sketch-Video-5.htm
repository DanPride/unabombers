<strong>Unabomber</strong> At Scene After Blast 



<strong>SOURCE:</strong> ASSOCIATED PRESS 



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> BY JENIFER WARREN and RICHARD C. PADDOCK 



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>DATELINE:</strong> SACRAMENTO, Calif.  



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Sacramento police said Thursday that they videotaped a man resembling the 
elusive 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> in the crowd that gathered around the blast site where a terrorist's bomb 
killed timber lobbyist Gilbert Murray in April.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Police videotaped the crime scene and surrounding crowd when they arrived there 
and noticed that a man abruptly left when he realized he was being filmed, said 
Homicide Lt. Joe Enloe.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">When police studied his image later, they saw that he was wearing aviator-style 
sunglasses that are similar to those worn by the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> when he was seen in 1987--the only known sighting of the serial terrorist.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The man, who appeared to be in his 40s or early 50s, also had a mustache like 
the 
<strong>Unabomber's.</strong> He was wearing a baseball cap with an unrecognizable logo and a watch with a 
distinctive symbol on its face.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;This guy caught our attention because he obviously didn't want to be 
photographed,&quot; Enloe said. 
&quot;Was he cutting work? Cheating on his wife? Is he wanted for something else? We 
don't know. But he left the area quickly when he knew we were looking at him.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Meanwhile, scrap metal dealers in the San Francisco area say they have been 
shown a grainy photograph of a man by FBI investigators, along with a blown-up 
close-up of a watch with an unusual face.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">FBI agents have been showing possible 
<strong>witnesses</strong> a photograph lifted from a videotape, hoping to 
<strong>identify</strong> the subject of the picture in connection with the elusive 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> acknowledged FBI spokesman George Grotz.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But the FBI's Grotz said agents do not believe the individual in the photograph 
is the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> who has killed three and wounded 23 during a 17-year reign of 
terror. He would not specify what connection the man in the photo might have to 
the case or whether the picture was taken from the Sacramento police video.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Sacramento police said they turned over at least one still print from the 
videotape to the FBI, but said they did not know if the FBI photo came from 
Sacramento.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI also said Thursday it has no plans to release a new composite sketch of 
the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong>--drawn by the artist who prepared the original--that for the first time shows him without sunglasses.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The artist, a former consultant for the task force hunting the serial bomber, 
has distributed the sketch to federal agents and to local police departments.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">FBI spokesman Grotz said investigators prefer an earlier composite sketch of 
the suspect with 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">his sunglasses on because they believe it to be 
&quot;the best likeness&quot; available.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He said the FBI sees no need to release a 
new sketch because the 
<strong>witness</strong> who spotted the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> in 1987--the only known sighting of him--&quot;is very pleased&quot; with the drawing.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The new sketch of the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> was drawn by Canadian artist Robert Exter, who drew the first based on the 
only sighting of him--in a Salt Lake City parking lot in February 1987. Exter, whose work includes 
sketches of the notorious Green River serial murder suspect in Washington 
state, said he mailed his new drawing to the FBI in December.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I don't understand why they won't use it,&quot; Exter said in an interview. 
&quot;If it's on target, which I believe it is, then he might panic and blow his 
cover.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">At the time he prepared the original sketch, Exter said he was asked by 
investigators to draw the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> without sunglasses but felt he lacked the skills to do so. In 
recent years, however, Exter has consulted with anthropologists and learned how 
to study human skull structure to determine eye shape and size.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The eyes he gave the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> 
&quot;may not be exact, but they are definitely in the ballpark,&quot; Exter said. 
&quot;When you have a certain shape of skull, there's not a whole lot of variation in 
the eyes--except maybe in their cant.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Exter said he was moved to re-sketch the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> without glasses after the death of New Jersey advertising executive Thomas 
Mosser Dec. 10, 1994. He said he believes the sunglasses--which obscure a large portion of the bomber's face--discourage people from attempting to recognize a suspect.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I thought if we gave this guy eyes, it might trigger something before he kills 
somebody else,&quot; Exter said.
