</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Sometimes reality is more horrifying than the gruesome films that Hollywood 
churns out to scare people.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A scientist in California opens a paper envelope that he received in the mail.  
It explodes, blowing off several of his fingers. A computer professor in 
Connecticut is critically injured when a package explodes in his office. An 
advertising executive dies in his New Jersey kitchen while opening a parcel 
that was delivered to his home - a parcel that turned out to be a bomb.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">People dead. People injured. People victimized by hideous acts of violence 
perpetrated upon them by an anonymous terrorist who has operated without 
detection for 16 years, killing two people and injuring at least 23 others in 
eight states.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Death sometimes makes sense. A person slips away, old and sick and tired.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Disease and accidents take their toll. But how do grieving survivors reconcile 
themselves to a death caused by an anonymous letter 
bomb? How does a family put their lives back together after burying a father 
who was struck by an unknown attacker for a reason that may never be discovered?
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Authorities say the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> as this terrorist is called, often goes after university people and sometimes 
people who have something to do with computers. As we noted in 1993, after a 
previous round of bombings, this sicko is attacking free expression, bringing a 
chill over man's search for knowledge.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The government is offering a million-dollar reward for information leading to 
the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> arrest and conviction. That might seem like a lot of money for the government 
to pay for information. But it's not too much. All reasonable steps should be 
taken to bring this killer to justice - ideally on charges that carry the 
federal death penalty.
