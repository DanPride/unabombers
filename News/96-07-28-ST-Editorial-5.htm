<p class="body" align="Left">ACROSS America this morning the Stars and Stripes is at half mast once more. It 
has barely risen since Easter. The first anniversary of the Oklahoma bombing, 
the attack on the barracks in Dhahran, the loss of TWA flight 800, and now the 
dead and injured in Atlanta. The nation has spent too long in remembrance this 
summer. The Olympic Games was to have been a chance to wave the flag in its 
proper place: at the head of the pole, on top of the world. The American people 
heralded each golden victory last week with a sense of triumphalism that at 
times seemed to border on the hysterical. Perhaps it was relief that all was 
well with the world, that Team USA was a winner once more. The nightmare of 
international terrorism could be forgotten for the glories of the Dream Team. 
The authorities had nicknamed Atlanta 
&quot;Fort Sport&quot;, but the events of the past 12 
days have shown that America is no longer a fortress. The growing belief that 
the loss of TWA 800 was caused by a bomb planted at Kennedy Airport and the 
explosion in Centennial Park yesterday show that this is a country of 250 
million potential targets. It was appropriate that among those who witnessed 
the Atlanta bombing was the American swimmer Janet Evans. The former gold 
medallist has barely been off the TV screens all week since her failure in 
these Games. She is a slick performer, graciously wounding her opponents, 
primarily the Irish gold medallist Michelle Smith, with allegations of 
cheating, eyes wide with her own integrity.  
Moments before the bomb exploded in the Swatch Pavilion at the AT&amp;T Global Olympic Village she was giving yet another interview, this time for 
German TV. As the sharp crack of detonation, then the crash of broken glass 
reached the room, she was transformed. No longer the confident Miss America, 
but a terrified young girl, clutching at the arms of her interrogator before 
wordlessly fleeing for safety. But where is safe in America now? So long free 
from the perils of other lands, its citizens woke up yesterday with a campaign 
of terror on their doorstep. Like Evans, they are as unused to being the 
victims as they are to losing. Both are hard to comprehend. It will take some 
getting used to. Somehow the attack on the Olympics establishes a pattern, a 
routine of violence that is familiar elsewhere. The determination of the 
International Olympic Committee and the 
Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG) to carry on the Games as usual 
cannot conceal that the future must be business as unusual. Where next? The 
final of the baseball World Series this autumn? The Super Bowl next January? 
Disneyworld? There are many targets for the potential terrorist, more symbols 
of the American way of life than just the White House. Already President 
Clinton has warned that internal airport security will be stepped up and that 
this will mean longer queues and more expensive air fares. But a metal detector 
to meet Mickey Mouse? And the only thing most American shops want to know about 
the contents of their customers' bags is the number on their credit cards. 
Atlanta thought it was prepared. There were bomb squads at every site and a 
system of passes and accreditation so ruthlessly effective that at times it 
almost 
threatened to paralyse the Games. But the rock concert which was the target of 
the bombers was outside the inner ring of steel, a free event for the ordinary 
fan to enjoy, to dance and swap pin badges. Even though a security guard 
spotted the knapsack with the device within minutes, even though police had 
already begun to clear the area, it was already too late. As London and Belfast 
have long discovered, you only 
<strong>identify</strong> your loopholes by bitter experience. America fears terrorism, but has not 
lived with it. Faced with the prospect of the IRA in the cities of Britain, the 
tourists take off their Burberry raincoats and stay in Kansas. The first rattle 
of shot in the Gulf War was enough to frighten the Hollywood tough guys from 
the Cannes film festival. Many Americans do not venture abroad at all, where 
the food is funny and the air conditioning 
never works. They prefer to experience the world second-hand. They can walk the 
Great Wall of China in Florida, see the Cathedral of Notre Dame while munching 
a jumbo tub of popcorn and slurping Coke at their local cinema. The sense of 
superiority that romanticises the IRA as freedom fighters and pours dollars 
into Dublin may now seem less certain. America is learning the lesson of cause 
and effect, particularly in Israel. Foreign adventures can sometimes bring back 
unwanted souvenirs. Somehow America always seemed safe, an island in an 
uncomfortable world. From time to time - two world wars, Korea, Bosnia - it can 
ride out like John Wayne, but always return to shut the gates of the fortress.  
Such disasters which befall its citizens are mostly acts of God or nature; 
tornadoes, hurricanes, blizzards and 
floods. Even the other hazards were home-grown - the car and the air crash, the 
right to bear arms. A reporter interviewing doctors at the hospital where many 
of the bomb victims were taken was told that the casualty toll was no worse 
than for a typical Friday night. These things are part of life. Terrorism is 
not. And the American brand seems to be a particularly virulent strain. At 
least the British Government knows that the IRA wants a united Ireland when it 
lays waste a Manchester shopping centre. It can seek to negotiate, to move on 
from the gun to the ballot box. Likewise the atrocities of ETA and the Tamil 
Tigers may be mindless, but not motiveless. The threat to America is still 
nameless and faceless. Probably it is revenge. No one has yet claimed 
responsibility for Atlanta, nor, if it proves to be a terrorist bomb, 
TWA 800. The identity of the World Trade and Oklahoma City bombers was known 
only because they were caught, the result of good detective work and luck. 
America is likely to need a great deal more of both, although prevention is 
more likely than cure. Suspicion almost immediately falls on the Arab world. 
And while far-Right fanatics and militiamen are also a possibility, it should 
be remembered that the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> was neither. Finding those responsible will not be easy. This is a nation of 
foreigners as much as it is of nutcases. 
<strong>Witnesses</strong> to the explosion at the Games seemed confused by the flash and noise, the 
rapidly fading plume of smoke. Some thought it was a pyrotechnic stunt to end 
the rock concert. Others that it was fireworks or lightning. No one is likely 
to make the same mistake next time. An age of innocence is over.
