</p><p class="body" align="Left">College professors across the country have been warned to be wary of their 
mail today after two prominent scholars were injured by mail bombs.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">At Yale University on Thursday, David Gelernter, 38 - nationally renowned for 
developing a program that links many small computers to solve huge problems - 
opened a bomb in his New Haven, Conn., office.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Gelernter suffered severe wounds to his hands, abdomen, chest and face. He ran 
from his office to the nearby campus health center for help.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In Tiburon, Calif., north of San Francisco, on Tuesday, Charles Epstein, 59, a 
geneticist who has broken ground with his research of Down syndrome and other 
genetic diseases, opened a letter bomb sent to his home.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Epstein lost several fingers and suffered a broken arm and severe abdominal 
injuries. He ran out of his house and collapsed on a neighbor's lawn after the 
blast.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Federal agents, working with tiny fragments of evidence, are trying to find out 
if the bombings are related to each other or<table>

serial bomber - quiet in recent years - is known at the FBI as the 
&quot;unabomber&quot; because he frequently targets universities.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Forensically, there's some similarities and, of course, since there's been some 
professors involved as victims, there's a possibility this may be connected,&quot; says FBI spokesman Rick Smith.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Former FBI bomb expert Robert Quigley says agents will be able to tell from 
bomb fragments whether the blasts are the work of a serial bomber.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;In his bombs, a signature shows up,&quot; Quigley says. 
&quot;The way he used wood in his bombs and the way he tied certain things together.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Between 1978 and 1987 bombings targeted educators and business<table>

in six states left 21 people injured; one dead. Some cases:
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In 1979 a bomb exploded in a mail bag aboard a United Airlines flight from 
Chicago to Washington, D.C., forcing an emergency landing.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In 1980 the president of United Airlines had a bomb explode in<table>

California, Michigan and Utah.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The serial bomber didn't strike for three years from 1982 to 1985. Then, there 
were four blasts in seven months, including one that killed a Sacramento, 
Calif., computer rental store owner.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">On Thursday, college officials - who feared copycats and did not want to be 
named publicly - warned faculty to watch for suspicious packages at work and at 
home.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Quigley says whether the recent bombings were from his old nemesis or a new FBI 
foe, more may follow.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Once you have a bomb go off, your big threat is from a copycat bomber,&quot; he says. 
&quot;You can almost be assured of a few more bombs afterward.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Looking for telltale signs
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The U.S. Postal Service carries about 160 billion pieces of mail a year, and 
says it's impossible to screen them 
all for bombs.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Bomb experts say mail bombs frequently have similarities.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Common signs:
- Stains on a package. Explosive chemicals often leave marks.
- Excessive postage. Bombers typically avoid going into post offices where they 
could be questioned or identified.
- Erratic writing on the address label.
- No return address.
