</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The return of a notorious serial bomber to his murderous ways is reviving old 
memories for past victims and the law enforcement officials who have sought him 
unsuccessfully for 16 years.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Nearly nine years to the day after the so-called 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> first killed someone, he struck again Saturday, when a New Jersey advertising 
executive was killed after opening a mail bomb.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Sacramento Sheriff's Detective Bob Bell remembers the first deadly blast, on 
Dec. 11, 1985, that instantly killed businessman Hugh Scrutton.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">For nearly a decade since, Bell pursued the unknown bomber, running down 
hundreds of leads, running into many brick walls. But he's not giving up.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;One of these days, he's going to get careless,&quot; says Bell. 
&quot;He may end up in the emergency room, or someone could point (investigators) to 
the right guy. We will not let this man get away with murder.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Scrutton was killed when he found a paper sack outside the back door of his 
fledgling computer business and picked it up to put it in a Dumpster. He died 
of massive chest injuries.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;There was shrapnel all through the building and on the roof,&quot; Bell says.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Hugh Scrutton didn't have a chance.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The latest incident only underscores how difficult it is to catch a clever 
bomber, investigators say. Even though they've failed to 
find the bomber, some of his past victims have nothing but praise and sympathy 
for the agents.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The poor guys, they're at a loss,&quot; says Diogenes Angelakos, a University of California Berkeley professor, who 
was severely burned on his right hand by a bomb left in the faculty lounge in 
July 1982. 
&quot;What can they do?&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Angelakos, 75, says he's still very cautious opening packages.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The reason it's so difficult (to find) a serial bomber is because the bomber 
most likely has no direct personal connection with the victims,&quot; says Jim Cavanaugh, an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms 
who worked on the 
<strong>Unabom</strong> task force and is now looking for the 
&quot;Dixie bomber&quot; who tried this year to kill the president of ABC-TV with two mail bombs.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;There are three kinds of motives - personal, corporate (such as 
a disgruntled worker) or moral/philosophical,&quot; Cavanaugh says. 
&quot;The last one is the most difficult because you're dealing with feelings or 
thoughts in people's head.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In other developments:
</p><p class="body" align="Left">-- CNN reports that the latest bombing victim may have gotten a call at his 
office from the bomber telling him to expect a package. At least two other 
targets also had received calls before receiving bombs.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">-- Fragments of a leather camera bag were sent to an Atlanta lab Tuesday to 
determine whether it contained a bomb when shipped to a Kmart store in Fort 
Pierce, Fla. Employees became suspicious of a newly arrived package Monday 
afternoon and called police.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A bomb squad evacuated the store.
