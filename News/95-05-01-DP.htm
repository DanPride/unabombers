</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> Diane Eicher, Denver Post Health Writer 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The images of violence seem inescapable.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">There's a blown-up federal building and bloody Oklahoma City residents 
wandering dazed amid the rubble. Rescue workers look overwhelmed; clueless 
children are wide-eyed and terrified. A few days later an unsuspecting worker 
opens a package at a Sacramento, Calif., office and is killed when the bomb 
inside - attributed to a serial bomber nicknamed The 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> - goes off.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">And just when we're able to console ourselves because those incidents seem far 
away and almost surreal, our own TV and radio airwaves and newspapers are full 
of yet another violent act: A heavily-armed man walks into a Littleton grocery 
store and kills three and wounds another before he is captured.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">These are anxious times.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">People who are actually involved in or witness traumatic events like the 
Oklahoma bombing or the grocery store shootings are vulnerable to a condition 
called post-traumatic stress disorder.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But the rest of us, too - just in trying to cope with the daily stresses of 
life, or seeing all the bad that goes on around us - may get hit with an 
anxiety disorder.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">More than 28 million Americans suffer from an anxiety disorder each year; 
nearly one in four will be affected at 
some point in their lifetimes.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Anxiety disorders include conditions like phobias, generalized anxiety, panic 
disorders, obsessive compulsive behavior and post-traumatic stress.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">They're the nation's most common mental health problem, costing the country 
more than $ 46 billions in absenteeism, job loss and alcohol or substance abuse.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;All these disorders have a biological component to them 
 some people are more vulnerable to them,&quot; said Dr. Michael Weissberg, psychiatry professor at the University of Colorado 
School of Medicine.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He said it's a rare person who wasn't affected by watching the coverage of the 
Oklahoma disaster, and symptoms as vague as insomnia after watching news 
reports can be a sign that something is wrong.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Some people are able to process the tragedy on their own and by talking about 
it, while for others, the anxiety created 
by such an event can linger and get worse, he said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Some of the symptoms of anxiety disorders are easy to recognize: Your heart 
races every time you leave home, or you're fearful of social encounters of any 
kind.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">You experience repeated episodes of extreme terror that include chest pain, 
difficulty breathing, a racing or pounding heartbeat, nausea and a fear of 
dying.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Or you're walking down a familiar street, and suddenly, for no apparent reason, 
you feel dizzy, out of control and terribly frightened.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Despite their seemingly terrifying - and disabling - nature, anxiety disorders 
are highly treatable. But only a fraction of the people who experience them get 
help, say experts. They may be embarrassed or afraid, or not realize there's a 
solution.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">And most people's threshold for tolerating the discomfort created by an anxiety 
disorder is 
actually too high: They wait too long to seek help.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Rarely does someone come in complaining of these symptoms and get told, 'This 
isn't a problem,' or 'Nothing to worry about,&quot;' said CU's Weissberg.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;People often ascribe the symptoms to their character, or to their personality, 
and they tend to do all sorts of self-treatment before seeking professional 
help.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But anytime a condition starts impacting one's life - either by affecting work, 
or a marriage or other relationships - it's reasonable to talk to a doctor, he 
said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">An easy and inexpensive way to get help happens on Wednesday, named National 
Anxiety Disorders Screening Day by the National Institute of Mental Health.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Free screenings will be offered around the country, including at 4 p.m. at the 
Colorado Psychiatric Hospital auditorium on the University of Colorado Health 
Sciences 
Center campus (call 270-8314) , and at 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. at Northpoint 
Counseling Center, 11684 Huron St., Suite 106, Northglenn (no registration 
required).
</p><p class="body" align="Left">For the locations of other facilities that will offer screening, call 
1-800-442-2020.  Participants will see a video that depicts the symptoms of 
anxiety disorders, complete an anonymous written test, and have an opportunity 
to meet with a mental health professional and get a referral if appropriate.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">For more information on these various disorders, consider:
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The American Psychiatric Association has a free pamphlet, 
&quot;Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder;&quot; write to APA, Dept. NYT, 1400 K St. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20005. Another 
pamphlet, 
&quot;Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder,&quot; is available for $ 2.50 from the Anxiety Disorders Association of 
America, 6000 Executive Boulevard, No. 513, Rockville, Md. 20852.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> To help those concerned about panic disorder, the National Institute of Mental 
Health offers free brochures and resource information. Call 1-800-647-2642 or 
write to the institute, Panic Disorder Education Program, Room 7C-02, 5600 
Fishers Lane, Rockville, Md. 20857.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> There's a new toll-free hotline about obsession compulsive disorder, a 
biological condition involving intrusive thought and the compelling need to 
perform repetitive behaviors, such as excessive hand-washing and the need to 
check things over and over. Call 1-800-639-7462 for free booklets and access to 
the Obsessive Compulsive Foundation.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A new paperback book by Jerilynn Ross, president of the Anxiety Disorders 
Association of American, 
&quot;Triumph Over Fear&quot; (Bantam), discusses the 
diagnosis and treatment of anxiety, panic attacks and phobias.
