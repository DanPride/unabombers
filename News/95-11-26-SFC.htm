 INFLAMMATORY RHETORIC SERVES NO PURPOSE
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Editor -- It does not serve the cause of a just and negotiated peace between 
Israel and the Palestinians when a discussion begins with inflammatory, 
absolutist rhetoric (Edmund Hanauer, Open Forum, May 19).
</p><p class="body" align="Left">I believe it is time to stop using terms like ''Israel's oppressive occupation 
policies'' and ''seized Palestinian land.'' The reality is that the negotiators 
are trying to work out borders and other arrangements to provide livable space 
for all the parties.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">I would not like to get into a point-by-point refutation of Mr.  Hanauer's 
claims and statements about Israeli abuse of Palestinians.  Israel is a 
democracy, with rule of law. It is illegal for the police to torture or kill 
prisoners, just as it is in the United States.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">As an advocate of free speech, I believe in the right of anyone to make almost 
any political claim. However, this article is such a jumble of misleading, 
angry statements that if I were on the board of the editorial page, I would 
have judged it not worthy of space in The Chronicle's Open Forum.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">MIDEAST 'NICENESS'
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Editor -- In his Open Forum piece, ''Terrorism and American Policy,'' Edmund 
Hanauer reiterates the myth that if Israel were only nicer to Palestinians, 
there would be peace.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">However, the truth is if Israelis were only nicer, there would not be an 
Israel. On the other hand, if the Palestinians were only nicer, there would be 
two states today.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Israel has held itself up to a remarkably humane standard in its treatment of 
Palestinians. How many times would most nations, or people for that matter, 
tolerate attacks on their lives? Imagine how Iraq or 
Syria would have acted if they were in Israel's position.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The only way to act peaceably with someone who wants you dead is to die.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Israel will never choose death, and will continue to defend itself, both 
proactively and reactively, until it is no longer necessary.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Israel is a great practitioner of human rights, lest we forget, among them is 
the right to defend one's self.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">'DIRTY SEAT BELTS'
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Editor -- I read with relish the page one story, ''Japanese Say Dirty Cars 
Cause Seat Belt Problem.'' Finally, a chance to beat Japan at its own game! As 
a successful importer and an unsuccessful exporter to Japan, my ears ring with 
excuse after excuse of why our products are not suitable for the Japanese 
market. Whether it's the well-publicized ''rice that is not sticky enough,'' ''skis made for the wrong type of snow'' or the less interesting but just as 
severe examples from my company, Japan adamantly refuses our products. Even 
with the plummeting dollar against the yen, the trade gap keeps widening. This 
is the major reason why Japan doesn't need tariffs like the ones being proposed 
on luxury vehicles -- their market is programmed to stifle imports.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Instead of trying to legislate change with Japan, we need to learn from them. 
This seat belt thing is the perfect example. The seat belts are failing because 
the Japanese do not understand our market. There is a market requirement in 
America, seat belts must be able to survive in a hamburger and french-fry 
grease environment. In 1987, when these seat belts first hit the market, it was 
clear that the number of drive-in restaurants was escalating. If we weren't 
supposed to eat and drink in our cars, why does 
every car of the subject models have a built-in drink holder? Let's face it, if 
the Japanese car makers just rode around with a family on a weekend outing, 
they would never have provided us a product so inappropriate for our 
marketplace. We need to take it to the next level, and be disciplined about 
requiring from Japan as they require from us. This will conflict with the 
maverick entrepreneurship of the importer and the insatiable consumerism of the 
masses, but if we can't open their market, all we can do is shut down ours.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">LOGICALLY CHALLENGED
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Editor -- Let's see if I understand Leonard Whitney (Letters, May 12) correctly 
-- by stating my belief that The Chronicle publishes Lone Star leftist Molly 
Ivins with ''alarming regularity,'' I am somehow advocating censorship? I am 
not sure precisely how 
Mr.  Whitney defines censorship, but the definition in my Webster's Ninth that 
comes closest to what I believe he meant defines it as the practice of official 
examination of materials for objectionable matter.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Although I personaly find Ms. Ivins' columns to be quite objectionable, due to 
their consistent lack of logic and frequent hyperbolic diatribes against all 
things conservative, I am by no means in any ''official'' position in which I 
could prevent their publication, nor do I wish to be. I was merely stating my 
personal opinion that The Chronicle prints too much Molly Ivins these days and 
not enough, say, George Will.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">My letter was not written to ''defend Rush Limbaugh and his cohorts'' as much 
as it was to point out the hypocrisy of the Left for blaming the Oklahoma City 
tragedy on right-wing talk radio, 
while not uttering a peep as to the possibility that environmentally extremist 
rhetoric provided inspiration for the lunatic 
<strong>Unabomber.</strong> I never claimed that President Clinton, Molly Ivins or anyone else was 
advocating censorship, but rather that they were alleging a ludicrous 
cause-and-effect relationship in one instance, that, if in fact true, must by 
definition have been true in another similar (yet politically diametric) case.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Sorry, Leonard, but if the best you can do in response to my letter is to make 
this bizarre accusation, then my argument that the Left is logically challenged 
is only given further credence.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">SAVE THE SURGEON GENERAL
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Editor -- Floyd Brown's suggestion that the office of surgeon general be 
abolished merely because it has become a source of controversy is a cowardly 
attack on the office! The office of surgeon 
general is much more than a lightening rod for sparks from the tobacco lobby, a 
target of anti-abortion organizations or, thanks to the incumbent 
administration's nomination process, a match for crypto-racist fires.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The surgeon general, as head of the U.S. Public Health Service, is a key figure 
in assuring that the nation's medical research is done by the most talented 
people working on the most pressing problems through the National Institutes of 
Health, created as part of the PHS. The PHS does a superb job, considering the 
scant resources allotted to it, of bringing health care to marginalized Native 
Americans. The Centers for Disease Control, where epidemiologists track and 
guide our response to epidemics like the present Ebola outbreak, is staffed by 
PHS officers.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">As the most visible spokesperson on health for all of us, the surgeon general 
has the 
opportunity and obligation to help Americans understand pressing issues 
affecting our health. This effort comes from careful consideration of 
observable facts, not wishful thinking.  If the conclusions and recommendations 
don't sit well with us, we had better act to change the facts and not eliminate 
the messenger.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">DRILLING BAN AT RISK
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Editor -- I am outraged, yet again, by the manipulative tactics of the 
Republicans in Washington and their Contract On America. Yet, it is more than 
my anger with the Republican Party overall that forces me to write to you.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">It is my understanding that Bob Livingston and Ralph Regula, chairs of the 
House Committee and Subcommittee on Appropriations, have silenced the issue of 
extending the current moratorium on offshore oil drilling by refusing to take 
up the issue in committee.  It should be a law that an automatic 
review of existing legislation is mandatory so that no one can slip their 
desires through loopholes.  Americans pushed for and received protection for 
our coastlines. How can we so easily lose our rights without being heard? 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">There are some very basic wrongs in our process. We cannot just sit by and 
watch any longer. Americans need to stand up and make some noise about this!
