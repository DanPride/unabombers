</p><p class="body" align="Left">Busey may have OD'd
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Gary Busey was in serious condition Friday from an apparent
cocaine overdose after being found unconscious at home with a small
amount of the drug in his shirt pocket, authorities said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Investigators also found small amounts of other illegal drugs in
Busey's home, but he was not arrested due to his medical condition,
a police official said.  
&quot;&quot;His condition is currently serious but
improving,'' a hospital spokesman said.  
&quot;&quot;His prognosis for
recovery is good. '' Busey, 50, received an Academy Award nomination
in 1978 for The Buddy Holly Story.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Friends' actress to wed
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Kudrow, Phoebe on Friends and Ursula on Mad About You, will
marry French ad exec Michel Stern.  They've been engaged for about a
year and have shacked up for two months.  Kudrow, 31, not as thick
as her Friends character, holds a biology degree from Vassar.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A league of his own
</p><p class="body" align="Left">George Will has got a league of his own.  The syndicated
columnist was named commissioner of the Texas-Louisiana
Professional Baseball League on Thursday.  
&quot;&quot;He's a baseball
purist,'' said Jack Lazorko, director of operations for the
independent AA league, which had its first season last year.  Will
is a diehard ball fan and author of Men at Work: The Craft of
Baseball.  The league has teams in Lubbock, Amarillo, Corpus
Christi, Tyler, Harlingen, Abilene, Laredo, Pueblo, Colo., 
Mobile,
Ala., and Alexandria, La.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">U.S. composer honored
</p><p class="body" align="Left">American composer John Adams, 48, has won the annual $ 150,000
Grawemeyer Award for his 33-minute Violin Concerto.  Adams, best
known for his opera, Nixon in China, had the work premiered last
year by the Minnesota Orchestra.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Downhill writer
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Kurt Vonnegut: the Alberto Tomba of words?  The 72-year-old
author of the time-travel masterpiece Slaughterhouse Five said he
writes 
&quot;&quot;intuitively, reflexively, as if skiing down a steep
mountain slope with no time to think.  And as I look back on the
marks my skis have left on the slope, I see that what I wrote again
and again are stories of ordinary people who tried to behave
decently in an indecent society,'' Vonnegut said this week in a
talk sponsored 
by Rochester (N.Y.) Arts 
&amp; Lectures.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Allen can't visit Dylan
</p><p class="body" align="Left">For now, Woody Allen will have to remain out of the picture.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A state appeals court has rejected Allen's request to be allowed
regular visits with ex-lover Mia Farrow's adopted daughter Dylan.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Farrow's claim that Allen sexually abused the 9-year-old has never
been proved.  Two psychotherapists agree that 
&quot;&quot;Dylan remains deeply
resistant to visitation with (Allen) and that it would not be in
the child's best interest to force her to see him,'' the state
Supreme Court's Appellate Division said this week.  Allen's lawyer,
Elkan Abramowitz, said the filmmaker would not appeal the ruling.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;&quot;At the appropriate time, we will renew our application,''
Abramowitz said.  The judges said Allen's appeal ignored a subject
that one therapist thought would harm Dylan if contact were resumed
-- Allen's 
ongoing sexual relationship with Soon-Yi Previn, 23,
Dylan's adoptive sister.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mom 1: In her honor
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Bill Gates, the nation's richest man, has donated $ 10 million
to the University of Washington in Seattle in honor of his late
mother, the university said Friday.  It's the second major donation
the Harvard dropout and founder of Microsoft Corp. has made to the
university.  He donated $ 12 million in October 1991 to establish a
department of molecular biotechnology.  Forbes magazine ranked him
as the richest American in 1994 with holdings worth $ 9.35 billion,
mostly in Microsoft stock.  The latest gift will establish the Mary
Gates Endowment for Students, to support outstanding
undergraduates.  Mrs. Gates, who died in June 1994, was a 1950
graduate of the university and served on its board of regents from
1975 to 1993.

2: Need to talk
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Newt Gingrich, Prince Charles, Lisa-Marie Presley Jackson,
Drew Barrymore and Kato Kaelin are the top candidates for a good
heart-to-heart with mom, says a new poll.  The survey of 1,000
people, in honor of Mother's Day, comes courtesy of MCI.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Unabom call reported
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Bob Guccione thinks he might have received a call from the
elusive 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> and federal investigators want to talk to the
Penthouse publisher about it.  Guccione has offered to print a
lengthy manifesto from the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> who demanded national
publication of the article in exchange for ending his 17-year
terrorism campaign.  The federal Unabom Task Force, based in San
Francisco, hasn't heard a word from Guccione, FBI spokesman Rick
Smith said Friday.
