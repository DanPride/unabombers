<strong>SERIES:</strong> TERROR IN THE HEARTLAND BOMBING IN OKLAHOMA 



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> Dan Walters
 THE SACRAMENTO BEE 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong> 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The targets of political terrorism are not its immediate victims; they are 
merely pawns. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Terrorism is symbolism taken to extremes that exact terrible prices on those 
unlucky enough to be immediately involved.  A terrorist is both demonstrating 
-- or so he thinks -- that his perceived enemy is vulnerable, and attempting to 
goad his foe into overreacting in ways that will alienate the larger 
population.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">That's true regardless of the era, the geographic venue or the ideological 
conflict.  And it's certainly true of last week's horrific explosion that 
killed scores of people inside a federal office building in Oklahoma City. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">There are tens of thousands of Americans who see government as their mortal 
enemy.  They view the Branch Davidian debacle in Waco, Texas, for example, not 
as a gigantic bureaucratic screw-up but as a government plot to eliminate 
political opposition.  They believe that there are contingency plans to place 
gun owners and political dissidents in concentration camps.  They are dead 
certain that there are mysterious symbols on traffic signs to guide United 
Nations troops into a takeover of America, and that mysterious 
&quot;black helicopters&quot; are spying on them. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mostly, this paranoia is expressed in forms no more aggressive than letters to 
the editor or calls to radio talk shows.  But 
a few thousand have formed themselves into 
&quot;militias&quot; and engaged in paramilitary training -- for defensive purposes, they say -- 
and some others have gone completely around the bend and moved into aggressive 
violence such as the Oklahoma City bombing that claimed so many innocent lives. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">They, like all terrorists, would like nothing better than for federal, state 
and local governments to be panicked by public outrage into committing 
oppressive acts themselves in the name of improving security.  That, in their 
twisted minds, would 
&quot;prove&quot; that the governments are bent on control and that further violence is 
therefore warranted. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Governments that have countered revolutionary terror with oppression have 
regretted their decisions.  Its benefits, if any, have been fleeting; the 
escalation of violence eventually is self-defeating. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">It's important to keep that history in mind as we Americans ponder what price 
we are willing to pay to prevent acts such as the Oklahoma City bombing -- or 
perhaps the letter bomb incident that 
claimed a life Monday afternoon in downtown Sacramento -- from recurring. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">President Clinton says he wants a more aggressive campaign to monitor and 
infiltrate organizations suspected of plotting terror.  
&quot;We're going to have to be very, very tough in dealing with this,&quot; Clinton said Sunday, adding, 
&quot;I don't want to interfere with anyone's constitutional rights.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">But when the federal government was conducting clandestine investigations of 
civil rights and anti-Vietnam War groups during the 1960s, the FBI and other 
agencies were so aggressive that they were actually fomenting violence.  They 
were trampling the rights of Americans to hold extreme political views and 
communicate those to the broader public. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Any new laws or law enforcement programs must be targeted with surgical 
precision.  They must seek swift and severe justice for those who actually plan 
or commit violent criminal acts, regardless of their demented motivations, and 
exempt kooks who are 
just blowing off steam, no matter how extreme or unpopular their views may be. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">If we fail to make that admittedly difficult distinction, if we trade civil 
liberties for some false sense of security and begin punishing people for what 
they think or even say, we will be destroying what we think we are protecting.  
And the terrorists will have won.
