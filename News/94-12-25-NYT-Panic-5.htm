</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> 
By RICHARD BERNSTEIN 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">There is something about a bomb attack -- like the letter bombings in the 
<strong>Unabom</strong> case or Wednesday's firebombing on the subway -- that provoke a particularly 
intense fear.  The explosions seem to come out of nowhere, transforming an 
ordinary routine like going to work or opening a package into a deadly act. 
And, there is the randomness of it, the fact that it can seemingly happen 
anyplace and at any time.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Yet despite last week's explosion on the subway, which injured more than 40 
people, as well as the vastly larger blast at the World Trade Center nearly two 
years ago, officials and experts on security and terrorism were cautioning 
against overreacting to what were terrible but very rare incidents.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
&quot;I don't mean to sound callous about the tragedy of people injured in the subway 
attack, or killed by the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong>&quot; said Brian Jenkins, the deputy chairman of Kroll Associates, an investigative 
and corporate security firm. 
&quot;But in the United States, with 24,000 homicides a year, an American has a 
1-in-10,000 probability of being murdered, while the odds of being killed by a 
terrorist bomb are something less than 1 in 100 million, which is a ten 
thousandfold difference.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The incidents and the resulting consternation highlight a paradox.  On one 
hand, the incidents produce a kind of fear on the part of the public, in large 
part because they attract inordinate amounts of publicity. But the fact remains 
that terrorism, while scary and headline-grabbing, is, compared with other 
hazards, a minor threat.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;There is 
no fail-safe for these things, just as there are no fail-safes if you're 
walking on a street or in a shopping mall,&quot; said Lieut. Robert J. Valentino, a spokesman for the New York transit police. 
&quot;But these are very isolated incidents. We had one last week and there was the 
one the week before. Prior to that, we can't even think of the last time 
something like that happened.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">What has made the letter-bomb killing of a New Jersey advertising executive and 
last week's subway bomb seem particularly alarming is that they both occurred 
while people still have fresh memories of the explosion at the World Trade 
Center in February 1993, in which six people were killed.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Trade Center blast was a mammoth one, and the recent explosions minuscule 
in comparison. They varied also in technical sophistication; in the 
<strong>Unabom</strong> 
case the explosive was more intricate, while the subway explosive was crude. 
And yet the bombings share several basic characteristics. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">One common feature is that, as in most terror bombings, the Trade Center 
attack, the 
<strong>Unabom</strong> attack and the subway attack would have been very difficult to prevent. 
Security experts say that the measures needed to bring about perfect security 
would be so expensive and so intrusive that they would be impossible and 
undesirable in a democratic society.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">One reason for the difficulty of preventing such attacks is the simple freedom 
of movement that exists in American cities, and the impracticality of 
systematically searching people who go into subways or shopping centers or 
parking garages or movie theaters. The Transit Authority once considered 
placing metal detectors at certain subway stations, but did not go ahead with 
the idea because of logistics and constitutional concerns.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A second reason such attacks cannot easily be 
thwarted is that almost anybody can make a bomb if he or she is determined to 
do it.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Some explosives are very difficult to make, of course,&quot; said Edward M. Roy, an explosives expert at the New Mexico Institute of Mining 
and Technology. 
&quot;However, a lot of them are easy; they're made of materials that you can go to 
the hardware store and the greenhouse to get.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Even the 
<strong>Unabom</strong> attacker, who is known for the high craftsmanship of his devices, would not 
have needed any special training in weaponry, electronics or explosives. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;He does not have to be former military, or a chemical engineer or anything 
special,&quot; Mr. Jenkins said.  He added that while it takes skill to make a letter bomb, a 
crude device, like the one used in the subway, requires only a jar of gasoline, 
some wires, a battery and an alarm clock.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">One readily available 
book, 
&quot;The Anarchist Cookbook,&quot; for example, has recipes for pipe bombs and other explosives. Published by 
Barricade Books in New York, the book, which is essentially a compilation of 
material from police and military manuals, has sold two million copies since it 
was first published in 1971.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;It's sold in large quantity around university campuses, because it is sort of a 
gag to have it,&quot; said Lyle Stuart, the publisher of Barricade Books. 
&quot;But no one really uses it, as far as we know.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A bomb is, in fact, a relatively simple device. It requires just four main 
ingredients, none of them difficult to get. First is a flammable material or an 
explosive, like gunpowder or ammonium nitrate, an ingredient in garden 
fertilizer. Second is a source of power, usually a 
battery. Somewhat more difficult to make is the third ingredient, a fuse or 
detonator to make a spark. The fourth is some kind of timing device, so the 
bomber can make it go off when he wants it to.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But the real difficulty lies in putting these parts together in an effective 
bomb, experts say. A poorly constructed device, like the one apparently used in 
the subway, can do as much damage to the plotter as to the intended victims.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">While there is virtually no feasible method for preventing every determined 
bomber, there are a few signs to watch for. Lieutenant Valentino says that 
people should notify the transit police if they see a suspicious package, 
particularly a package left unattended, on the subway. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Letter bombs tend to have a lot of stamps, rather than a post office 
franking stamp, because the bomber, presumably, does not want to come face to 
face with a postal clerk.  There might well be no return address. It might have 
a peculiar smell, or there might be grease marks on it, from leaked explosives.
