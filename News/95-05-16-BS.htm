</p><p class="body" align="Left">While the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not yet decided whether it has 
the power to regulate nicotine as a drug, agency commissioner David A. Kessler 
has called for a campaign to stop youngsters from becoming addicted to tobacco. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Nicotine addiction begins as a pediatric disease, yet society as a whole has 
done little to discourage this addiction in our youth,&quot; Dr. Kessler said in a lecture at Harvard Medical School yesterday. 
&quot;We owe it to our children to help them enter adulthood free from addiction.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Dr. Kessler called for a comprehensive approach: making it harder for 
youngsters to get cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, telling them the serious 
health hazards and limiting advertising.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">* Seven high school students in Wheeling, W.Va., pleaded guilty yesterday to 
smoking on school grounds and were fined the maximum $ 5 plus $ 62 in court 
costs. They also faced a day's suspension from school. 


<strong>Unabomber</strong> hunt: 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">At the request of the FBI, forest rangers and sheriff's deputies in remote 
areas across California are searching for evidence that the elusive 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> has tested his deadly devices on national forest land in the Sierra Nevada. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The mysterious bomber, who authorities believe lives in Northern California, 
has mailed or placed devices that have killed three people and injured 23 since 
1978. In a recent letter to the New York Times, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> said he was growing weary of 
&quot;searching the Sierras for a place isolated enough to test a bomb.&quot; 


Grandmother charged: 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A 
Franconia, N.H., woman was charged yesterday with attempted murder after giving 
her two granddaughters an anti-depressant drug at their home on Mother's Day, 
the attorney general's office reported. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Virginia Rowell, 45, was expected to be arraigned today in Littleton District 
Court. Ms. Rowell, who also ingested the drug, was arrested at Littleton 
Hospital, where she remains hospitalized. Amber Rowell, 8, and Alyssa Rowell, 
2, were reported in stable condition at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. 


Sexual abuse plea: 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A Lebanon, Ohio, high school principal once accused in a murder-for-hire plot 
pleaded guilty yesterday to sexually molesting his former stepson. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Clarence Wilkinson was charged with gross sexual imposition for allegedly using 
force five years ago to sexually abuse the then 13-year-old boy. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Wilkinson, 44, once was accused in what police said was an aborted plot in 
which he and his ex-wife tried to hire the same hit man to kill each other. The 
charge was dropped later, prosecutors said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">* Glenn Harris, 33, a New York City gym teacher who ran away with a 15-year-old 
ninth grader two months ago, returned to New York to turn himself in, a school 
spokeswoman said today. 


The economy: 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Housing starts rose 0.4 percent in April, the first advance in four months, due 
to a gain in multifamily building. Construction of single-family homes 
continued to fall despite lower mortgage rates. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Commerce Department said today that construction of new single-family homes 
and apartments 
totaled 1.24 million at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, up from 1.23 million 
in March. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">* Led by a steep drop in auto production, industrial output fell 0.4 percent in 
April to its lowest level in nine months, recording back-to-back declines for 
the first time in more than three years. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">* Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan today called for a stepped-up attack 
on the federal budget deficit, warning that the United States can't count on 
foreign money indefinitely to finance its economy. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In a speech prepared for delivery to the National Association of Realtors, Mr. 
Greenspan also stressed the importance of price stability for the long-term 
health of the U.S. economy. 


For the record: 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A Maine woman and her four nieces -- 
ranging in age from 5 to 8 -- were found by searchers yesterday after spending 
a cold, damp night near a cranberry bog outside Middleborough, Mass. . . . 
Arizona reinstated the chain gang yesterday. . . . Convicted murderer 
Christopher Scarver, 25, was given two more life terms yesterday after pleading 
guilty in the beating death of serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer and another inmate 
in a Wisconsin prison.
