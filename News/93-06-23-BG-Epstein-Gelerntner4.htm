</p><p class="body" align="Left">The parcel bombs that exploded in the hands of two prominent professors here 
and in California this week are part of a string of 12 similar incidents dating 
to 1978 with victims from coast to coast, federal officials said yesterday.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The linkage to an unsolved serial bombing case, dubbed 
<strong>Unabom</strong> by investigators, was made after authorities examined physical evidence from 
the latest bombings sites, a Yale University computer science center and the 
suburban home of a San Francisco geneticist.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The maker, or makers, of each of the 14 explosive devices is the same,&quot; said Milt Ahlerich, special agent in charge of the FBI in Connecticut. 
&quot;We've had people here who are extraordinarily familiar with all of the previous 
bombings who have taken a good hard look at what was pulled out of the scene.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Ahlerich described the finding as a 
&quot;preliminary determination,&quot; but also said that investigators are virtually 
&quot;certain&quot; that all of the 14 the incidents are related.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">However, the finding that the bombings are connected appeared to offer limited 
consolation to federal authorities who have been unable to find out who 
produced the 12 explosive devices placed in seven states from 1978 to 1987, or 
why the bombs were made.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Ever since the first device was detonated, injuring a Northwestern University 
security guard in Evanston, Ill., investigators have struggled to establish a 
motive in a case as chilling as it is mysterious.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Nailing down the motive has been one of the most difficult aspects of the 
investigation,&quot; Ahlerich said. 
&quot;This is an extremely challenging case and has been for a long, long time.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">One factor that has made it difficult to find a motive, investigators said, is 
the relatively disparate collection of victims. Although most 
seem to have been university personnel working in computer sciences, airline 
personnel and computer dealers also have been targeted. The bombings have left 
one dead and 23 injured.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the latest attacks, investigators have noted an interest in genetics shared 
by a University of California researcher who lost several fingers on Tuesday, 
and by relatives of a Yale computer science professor seriously injured 
Thursday.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Charles Epstein, 59, is the head of medical genetics at the University of 
California at San Francisco. And David Gelertner, 38, is a reknowned computer 
scientist with a brother and sister-in-law who are Yale geneticists.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Yesterday, officials at Boston-area universities said they were stepping up 
precautionary measures with additional warnings and descriptions of packages 
that should be reported as suspicious.
