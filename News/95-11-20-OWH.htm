</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">'We Owe More to Russia' Margaret Carter, Omaha I am much distressed by the 
World-Herald editorial bashing Mr. Clinton for going to Russia instead of 
England for the celebration of V-E Day. If the Russians had not entered the 
Second World War and divided Hitler's army, we would be in German hands now.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">After World Wars I and II, we loaned England billions of dollars, many of which 
were unaccounted for or forgiven. Why do we owe the Brits anything? 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 'V-E Day in USA' Martin J. Caffrey, Omaha As a member of the armed forces on 
V-E and V-J Days, I can't understand why Mr.  Clinton was in Russia and not in 
the United States celebrating with us.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 'Gun Owners Are Miscast' Craig Welliver, Gothenburg, Neb.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">It is truly astounding how misled I have been for most of my life. I was always 
of the assumption that radicals who hijack planes, bomb buildings and kill 
innocent people were terrorists and thugs. Now I find that if the always 
non-prejudicial news media statements are taken as gospel, the true criminals 
are law-abiding American gun owners. Any individual who hunts or owns a 
sporting firearm of any kind is obviously a demented maniac or crazed serial 
killer bent on 
world destruction. If one enjoys shooting, he must be a 
&quot;gun nut&quot; or 
&quot;one of them militia-type goons.&quot; I have hunted and owned forearms for 35 years. No, I don't own an AK-47 or a 
grenade launcher. I've never been a member of a para-military subversive 
organization attempting government overthrow, nor do I intend to become so 
involved. But rest assured, if bringing home a couple of pheasants for the 
dinner table constitutes a threat to national security, then by all means haul 
me away and lock me up.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 'Don't Equate Bombings' Charles A. Sklenar, Omaha David Childs (&quot;U.S. Once Bombed Kids,&quot; May 13 Pulse) is missing something. There is a big difference between the 
Oklahoma City bombing of 1995 and the bombings of Japan and Germany in 
1944-45.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">If Japan hadn't bombed Pearl Harbor, we wouldn't have hit Hiroshima or 
Nagasaki. If Germany hadn't invaded Poland, used extermination camps on the 
Jews, destroyed Coventry in England and murdered some of my buddies at Malmedy 
after they were POWs, I'm sure Dresden would not have been firebombed.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Germany and Japan had to expect what they got. Oklahoma City did not.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 'Go Back to Phonics' Cindy Bazis, Omaha Of my four children learning to read, 
only my youngest has learned to by the whole-language reading program. This 
child is a fifth grader, has difficulty reading and, unlike my older children, 
does not have a love for books. She has been in the READ program for several 
years, off and on. I will be looking for a tutor this summer.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Whole-language reading programs sound good, 
but they don't get the job done. This is what parents mean when they say that 
we need to get back to the basics - a phonics-based reading program. Thank 
goodness for parents who have made their voices heard at their local school 
boards.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 'Bring On Competition' Michael T. Marr, Omaha A recent article in The 
World-Herald described how the long-distance companies and others have proposed 
to re-enter the local telephone market. Why? Because the local Bell companies 
have no competition.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Fostering direct competition with deregulation will lower prices for consumers.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Not afraid of monopolies? Just remember how much you paid for a gallon of gas 
when OPEC was still in power.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 'Leave Gambling to Iowa' Pat Vrchlavsky, Omaha World-Herald editorials in 
regard to not expanding the gambling laws have been right 
on target. So what if Iowa is drawing the 
&quot;gambling money&quot; over there? We do not need a further increase in our taxes than it will 
already take to counteract the problem that Iowa gambling will cause.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">We also wish to thank Governor Nelson and Mayor Daub for speaking out against 
the icnrease in gambling in Nebraska. Our thanks also to all the Nebraska state 
senators who voted against the bill on extending gambling.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Nebraska is a family-oriented state. Let's keep it that way.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 'Restore Petition Rules' J.R.  Warner, Omaha The laws pertaining to our 
petition rights had been virtually unchanged for 82 years prior to 1988. Now, 
with increased signature requirements, it is less likely that a successful 
petition campaign can be completed.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Call your state representative and say that you want the same amount of freedom 
for the people that the petition process gave us in 1987. The petition process 
is the best safeguard against runaway taxation.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 'Can't Quash Criticism' Brian L. Johnson, Lincoln According to the president, 
syndicated columnists and particular citizens, the ghastly acts of a few 
extreme militants in Oklahoma City had to have been provoked by Rush Limbaugh.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Five days a week, Rush can be heard criticizing the president's policies and 
ranting about the encroachments of the federal government, from overburdening 
tax rates to the colossal web of restrictions affecting businesses and personal 
life. As incredulous as it may seem, these topics have been arousing political 
disputes for the past 200 years and will probably never be agreed upon.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Liberals are content to tie disagreement with government to blowing up federal 
buildings. At the same time, Al Gore's criticism of the logging industry is 
not being considered to have provoked the notorious 
&quot;<strong>Unabomber&quot;</strong> who killed the president of the California Forestry Association last month. 
How convenient and selective for an ideology that is lacking any sort of 
substantive issue to combat the rise of conservatism.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 'Host Takes Critical Calls' Bud Greuter, Lincoln Phil Allen's Pulse letter 
said that Rush Limbaugh is being unfair by not talking to people that disagree 
with him about issues.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">This is simply not true. I have been listening to Limbaugh for a number of 
years. He constantly has conversations with people who disagree with him. I 
have never heard him retreat or cut people off, even when they get out of line. 
And he usually gives them more time than callers who agree with him. They 
really have to go crazy or get into name-calling before he tells them that he 
has to move on.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Maybe Mr. Allen should try calling him.
