</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A serial bomber who added to a brazen 17-year reign of terror with a fatal 
blast at a timber lobbying group here was inspired by the Oklahoma City 
bombing, experts said Tuesday.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;It does hurt his feelings when other bombings occur,&quot; said Lawrence Myers, who is writing a book on serial bombers. 
&quot;If he can get (Oklahoma suspect) John Doe 2 off the front page and his 
composite picture back on, he'd be very, very happy.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Authorities disclosed Tuesday they'd received new insight into the mind of the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> because he mailed two and possibly three letters from Oakland along with the 
parcel that arrived at the offices of the California Forestry Association 
Monday afternoon.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The timber group's president, Gilbert Murray, 47, died instantly after opening 
the meticulously wrapped package.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bomber is 
&quot;describing his actions and motives for the first time in 17 years,&quot; said the FBI's Jim Freeman, who heads the federal task force.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Sources told The Associated Press two letters went to former 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> victims. Written in a shaky hand, they included bizarre environmental demands. 
&quot;This guy has flipped out,&quot; AP's source said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The third letter reportedly went to The New York Times. A similar letter to the 
Times coincided with an attack that killed a New Jersey advertising executive 
last year. That letter aped a communique to the Times from the Trade Center 
bombers, another reason to suspect the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> is motivated by press clippings, Myers said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Most of us were watching the 
Oklahoma bombing identifying with the victims. He would have been more likely 
to identify with the perpetrators.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The suspect has set off at least 16 bombs across the country since 1978, 
killing three, including one other Sacramento man, and injuring 23.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Although the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> - so named because early targets were universities and airlines - has 
demonstrated a puzzling scatter-shot pattern, there are patterns. The suspect 
has a penchant for wood, both in the construction of his devices and in his 
targets. Many victims had wood or wood-associated words in names or addresses.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Also, many victims lived near Interstate 80, a cross-country freeway. 
Technology may play a role, too. Many of his devices bore the initials 
&quot;FC,&quot; possibly representing an obscene oath against computers.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;This man is brazen in the truest sense of the word,&quot; says Sacramento police homicide 
detective Joe Enlow. 
&quot;He isn't really hiding this is his bomb.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Agents from the San Francisco-based task force spent the day at Murray's 
downtown offices sifting for clues.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Investigators had expected to hear from the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> before summer, but he apparently stepped up his timetable because of the 
Oklahoma City 
&quot;challenge,&quot; analysts said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">FBI profilers have pegged the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> as a loner in his 40s, perhaps with a home shop where he hand-tools his bombs.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Even the box hinges are hand-crafted, investigators say.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;He's had bombs that look like a book, a notebook, a can of paint,&quot; said expert Murray Miron.
