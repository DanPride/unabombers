</p><p class="subheader" align="left"><strong>HEADLINE:</strong> FBI: Beware of bomber; Security beefed up at universities 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
Security was intensified at universities across the country yesterday in fear 
that scholars and researchers may be targeted by the mystery bomber who 
authorities say claimed his latest victim over the weekend.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But the FBI still had no leads in the death of advertising executive Thomas J. 
Mosser, who was killed Saturday when he opened a videotape-sized package in the 
kitchen of his posh home in suburban New Jersey.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI believes the North Caldwell, N.J., resident was the latest victim in a 
series of 15 bombings by a man the bureau has dubbed the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> because his previous attacks have targeted universities and airlines. Two 
people have been killed and 23 injured since the first bomb exploded in May 
1978 at the University of Illinois at Chicago.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">CNN reported that federal investigators think Mosser may have received a 
telephone call at his office from the bomber the day before he died, telling 
him to expect a package. At least two previous targets of the bomber received 
such calls.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Locally, Harvard University used its extensive computer networks to e-mail a 
precautionary warning to 10,000 students, faculty members and staffers, a 
spokesman said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I don't want to create the impression that Harvard is more alarmed than any 
other school,&quot; university spokesman James Wrinn said. 
&quot;Just want to alert people who go to school here and work here that they should 
be careful.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The e-mail warning advised anyone finding a 
&quot;suspicious&quot; package to turn it over to Harvard University Police.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Officials have speculated the bomber may have lost his job to a computer, 
leading him to pick victims with 
ties to high-technology.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The hunt for the bomber, who uses precisely constructed and powerful homemade 
devices, was made all the more pressing by fears he may soon strike again, a 
high-ranking FBI agent in Newark, N.J., said yesterday.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;We are still nervous about another bomb being out there somewhere,&quot; the agent said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The nationwide search for the bomber also spread into cyberspace yesterday as 
the FBI asked for help from users of the Internet computer network.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Dear Netters, the purpose for submitting the information on the Internet is 
twofold,&quot; the FBI's message said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;First, the Internet is another medium that enables us to reach as wide an 
audience as possible, to spread the word. Second, Internet users are precisely 
the type of individuals that 
 have been recipients of explosive devices attributed to 
<strong>Unabom;</strong> scholars and researchers.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI posted its offer of a $ 
1 million reward over the Internet for the capture and conviction of the bomber.
