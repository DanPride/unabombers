</p><p class="body" align="Left">Q: A recent Q&amp;A listed Vanderbilt University as one of the early targets of the 
<strong>Unabomber.</strong> What was the date? What happened? 


-Peter Pawlak, Crabapple

it was opened. One person, the secretary who opened the box, was injured.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Q: How can I recycle Type 4 plastic? Dry cleaners use it for clothing, but the 
dry cleaners won't take it back. It's also used for the wrappers on my 
newspapers. 


-James Carter, Mableton 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A: Neighborhood grocery stores with recycling programs will take the plastic 
back. In the recycling industry, it's known as 
&quot;film&quot; because it's a thin film of plastic, said Bob Rickman at Southeast Recycling. 
Several chains, including Kroger, recycle this grade, he said. The same type of 
plastic also is used in grocery bags.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Q: In the ''Let's Talk&quot; want ads, a variety of abbreviations is used. One, ISO, appears over and over, 
but doesn't seem related to gender, race or sexual preference. What does it 
mean? 


-Drew Downey, Atlanta 

A: ISO: In search of.

Q: How can I get an autographed picture of President Clinton? 

-Laura Boyette, Hoschton 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A: Requests for photographs of Clinton (as well as first lady Hillary Clinton, 
Vice President Al Gore or Tipper Gore) may be made in writing. Mail to: Office 
of Presidential Correspondence, White House, Washington, D.C. 20500. Or fax to: 
(202) 456-2461. To listen to a recorded message on procedures for requesting 
photos and greetings from the White House, call (202) 456-2724.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Q: Why do we need new area codes? With 7 digits in 
various combinations, nearly 10 million numbers would be available for Atlanta. 


-R.A. Collins, Winder 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A: It's not so simple, according to Ken Branson, a spokesman for Bellcore, a 
communications software firm in Livingston, N.J. First, there's a finite number 
of numbers, and once they're gone, there are no more. Some combinations of 
numbers aren't available at all, he said, such as one starting with 555 (that's 
for directory assistance). And numbers can't begin with a zero or a one, 
because they would access operators and long distance. Still others are out of 
circulation because they're reserved for internal use by telephone companies 
for testing and other purposes. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">But the most important factor, Branson said, is the 
&quot;astronomical&quot; growth of numbers now being used by individuals and businesses. Back in the 
1960s, 
a family might have had only two lines: one for the residence, the other for a 
parent's business. These days, parents and children might have 10 or more 
numbers, including residence and business phones, car phones, faxes and 
beepers. The only practical solution, Branson said, is to add area codes, and 
as the areas grow, to break them up into still more area codes.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Q: How can I write to Russian President Boris Yeltsin? I want to send him a 
letter concerning an interview he had with Diane Sawyer. 


-Alice Presley, College Park 

A: The address: Boris Yeltsin, The Kremlin, Moscow, Russia.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">FBI FILES: The Atlanta FBI office reports receiving an 
&quot;overwhelming&quot; number of inquiries in response to an item in Monday's Q&amp;A. It asks that people write, not call, to 
access records under the Freedom of Information and Privacy acts. To ensure 
that records (if they exist) are released only to individuals having a right to 
the information, provide your name, Social Security number and date and place 
of birth, and have your signature witnessed by a notary public. 


Send the letter to: FBI, P.O. Box 98128, Atlanta, Ga. 30359-1828.
