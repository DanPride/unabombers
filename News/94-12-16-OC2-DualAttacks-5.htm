</p><p class="body" align="Left">Investigators and crime experts who have followed the career of the mysterious 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> are waiting nervously for the next shoe to drop. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;These things come in pairs,&quot; said Bob Bell, a Sacramento County homicide detective who has followed the 
<strong>Unabom</strong> case since a fatal attack there in 1985. 
&quot;I'm really waiting for the next one ... I think it's part of his twisted game.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> -- a suspect named for a series of attacks on university officials -- has a 
habit of following one attack with a second bombing within two months. He has 
followed that pattern three times since he began placing and mailing his 
homemade bombs in 1978. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Those who follow the case fear the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> will strike again soon in the wake of the mail-bomb attack Saturday that 
killed advertising executive Thomas Mosser in his New Jersey home. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I don't know what he's going to do, but I know he's going to keep doing it, and 
it will be a variation on the pattern,&quot; said Michael Rey-nolds, who spent 10 months tracking the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> for an article published in Playboy magazine. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Federal investigators have not commented on the possible trend. But 
Lou Bertram, a retired FBI agent who worked on the case, said he expected 
another bombing soon. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In 10 attacks since 1982, the bomber has deviated from the pairs pattern only 
once. That was in 1987, the only time the alleged bomber was ever seen planting 
a device. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In that case, a secretary in a Sacramento, California, computer firm saw a man 
place what turned out to be a bomb in the company parking lot. An employee who 
tried to clear away the object was injured in the explosion. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> did not strike again until last year. Bertram suspects that the intense hunt 
that followed the 1987 sighting may have disrupted the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> pattern.
