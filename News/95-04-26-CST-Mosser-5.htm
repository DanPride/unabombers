</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>DATELINE:</strong> SACRAMENTO, Calif.  



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A mail bomb that exploded in a forestry trade group's headquarters Monday and 
killed a man probably was sent by the bomber known as 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> the FBI said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Authorities said the bomb--contained in a heavy package the size of a shoebox--was addressed to the California Forestry Association, an industry group that 
lobbies for legislation on behalf of timber and mill companies. The victim was 
identified as Gilbert B. Murray, 47, of suburban Roseville, Calif. He was an 
association lobbyist and vice president.  He had a wife and three children.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Over the last 16 years, 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> has been blamed for 15 attacks that have killed two other people and injured 
23.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Monday's explosion occurred shortly after 2 p.m. when a female clerical worker 
gave the package--sent through the mail and wrapped in brown paper--to Murray, police said.  The bomb exploded immediately and killed Murray. None 
of the five other people in the office was hurt.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The similarities in the forensics preliminarily reviewed at the crime scene 
strongly suggest the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong>&quot; FBI Special Agent Richard Ross said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The special federal Unabom task force from San Francisco arrived Monday 
afternoon and is taking over the case, Ross said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Investigators say the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> appears to be fascinated with wood. Some of his bomb parts were carved out of 
wood and twigs have been included in a bomb. His most 
recent victim, advertising executive Thomas Mosser, killed at his home in 
December, lived on Aspen Drive in North Caldwell, N.J.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The president of United Airlines, Percy A. Wood of Lake Forest, received one of 
the bombs in 1980 and was injured.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The California Forestry Association is a nonprofit trade association 
representing wood products companies and commercial forest landowners. In 1993, 
it filed an unsuccessful petition asking that the northern spotted owl be 
removed from the endangered species list.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The name 
&quot;<strong>Unabomber&quot;</strong> is derived from the FBI's designation of the case as Unabom. It was so named 
because universities were among the early targets.
