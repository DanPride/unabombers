</p><p class="body" align="Left">Such acts are . . . stimulated by forces of hatred and malevolence . . .  (by)

</p><p class="body" align="Left">We hear so many loud and angry voices . . . today whose sole goal seems to 

be to try to keep some people as paranoid as possible . . . They spread hate. 

They leave the impression that . . . violence is acceptable . . . (in) some 

things that are regularly said over the airwaves in America.
- Bill Clinton

The late chief justice, speaking over the casket of John F. Kennedy, and 

the president, fresh from the rubble of Oklahoma City, were speaking of the 

same people - the bigots, the radio haters, the kindlers of 
&quot;venomous 

thoughts.&quot;
In 1995, as in 1963, those are code words for the far right.
Clinton had the easier time of it, for despite early reports of 
&quot;Middle 

Eastern&quot; suspects, the apparent bomber turned out to be a right-wing cuckoo.
(The White House later insisted Clinton wasn't 
&quot;pointing his finger&quot; at 

any individuals. But given his past diatribes about 
Rush Limbaugh and talk 

show 
&quot;hate preachers,&quot; his targets weren't hard to discern.)
Warren's problem, however, was the reverse of Clinton's. When shots were 

fired in Dallas, speculation quickly focused on local rightists. But when the 

gunman was captured only hours later, he was a Castro sympathizer. Undaunted, 

Warren plowed ahead as if Lee Oswald were a John Bircher.
THEIR REMARKS, separated by 32 years and countless acts of senseless 

violence, reflect a troubling reality: American public discourse has been so 

corrupted that we seek political advantage even in our most abject grief.
And make no mistake, political advantage is what this debate is about.
For there is no conclusive evidence - none - to suggest that the mad act of
either the Dallas or Oklahoma City murderers was born in the rantings of 

mindless talk shows or paranoid gun freaks.
Granted, it's not 
unreasonable to think that Tim McVeigh, the accused 

bomber, and his John Doe colleagues may have found comfort in the ignorant and
conspiratorial drivel that often spews from the radio or from militia groups. 

But to imply that the bomb issued directly from the blather is a breathtaking 

leap of logic unsupported by any facts now known.
None of which is to suggest that our civic discourse couldn't stand to be 

more civil. Clearly, it could. The airwaves would improve markedly with less 

Liddy and more Liszt, although there's something to be said for the safety 

valve that such call-in shows offer to frustrated paranoiacs.
But the sort of rhetoric emitting from Clinton and others betrays two 

disturbing tendencies in our national dialogue.
One is to assign political blame for non-political events. In its eagerness
to find rational explanations for irrational acts, American society has 

spawned a culture of 
victimology in which there's no room for the kind of 

unspeakable evil we saw in Oklahoma. Since no sane person could commit such a 

monstrous horror, we reason he must have been goaded on by others. What we 

miss, of course, is the plain fact that madness needs no reason.
A second tendency, closely related, is to believe such evil has only one 

political coloration, as if madness has any politics.
But think about it. The so-called 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> who differs in malevolence 

from McVeigh only in his level of efficiency, said in a letter last week that 

&quot;we are out to get scientists and engineers . . . (to) give encouragement to 

those who hate the industrial system.&quot; Should we should blame Ralph Nader, 

who has said auto companies 
&quot;are going to kill a lot of people?&quot;
LOS ANGELES erupted in fire and looting, but no one 
pointed fingers at 

Martin Luther King, who called urban riots 
&quot;a durable social phenomenon,&quot; or
at Floyd McKissick, the former head of the Congress of Racial Equality, who 

observed that 
&quot;black people don't own Harlem, so why should (they) care 

whether it burns down or not.&quot;
As for the militiamen's poisonous view of government, certainly none can 

rival the vast murderous conspiracy portrayed in 
&quot;JFK&quot; by Oliver Stone. Yet 

Stone, a man of the left, isn't excoriated by the president. He is showered 

with honors by Hollywood.
Let us lower the decibels, the Gordon Liddys who inflame tempers in search 

of ratings, and the Bill Clintons who seek to assign blame where none exists. 

Then, maybe the healing can begin.
