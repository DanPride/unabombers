</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"><a href="../SketchMid.htm#NAIC">NASA officials, concerned that the so-called 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> might target agency scientists, last week told the FBI to remove a computer 
file that was set up as the first 
&quot;Wanted&quot; poster in cyberspace. </a>

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI's Unabom file, accessible over the Internet, was created in the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's computer in December 1993 to 
solicit tips in the case. The Unabom file, which was the first known use of the 
Internet in a major criminal investigation, offers a $ 1 million reward for 
clues leading to the arrest of the elusive suspect who since 1978 has killed 
three and injured 23 in attacks from New Jersey to California.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The document, which can be read by computer users on to the World Wide Web, 
will be accessible at a new address after it is moved to a Justice Department 
computer. It includes a sketch of the bomber and recounts the case's 
chronology. The file appears to have been last updated in March. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In a phone conversation Thursday, David Cooper of NASA's Ames Research Center 
in California told FBI special agent Joel Moss that the FBI must remove the 
file by June 30 because NASA officials fear its presence might provoke the 
bomber to attack agency scientists, according to an internal FBI memo. Previous 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> victims have included a number of scientists and professors. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Neither Cooper nor Moss would say whether the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> had made specific threats against any NASA scientists. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;This is a sensitive 
issue here, and I've been advised not to comment on any of this matter until 
more time goes by,&quot; Cooper said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">NASA also told the FBI that agents working on the Unabom case may no longer 
receive e-mail about the case at the agency's Internet address and must remove 
any case files from NASA computers, the memo says. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Moss declined to comment. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI will move the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> file and another public file with information about last month's bombing of 
the federal building in Oklahoma City to a computer run by the Justice 
Department, a NASA spokesman said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Currently, a computer user who wants to read the FBI's 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> page would use a software program called a web browser that connects to files 
on the World Wide Web. The address of the 
FBI page, until the end of June, is http://naic.nasa.gov/fbi/ 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Officials said they do not yet know what the new address will be.
