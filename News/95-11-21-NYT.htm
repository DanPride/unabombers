<strong>UNABOMBER</strong> AND DAVID GELERTNER 



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> 
By STAVEN LEVY; 
Steven Levy is the technology columnist for Newsweek. His last article for this 
magazine was 
&quot;The Battle of the Clipper Chip,&quot; which described the Government's struggle to cope with digital data 
encryption.  



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong> 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">David Gelernter's second communication from the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> killer arrived last month. Like the first, it came in the morning mail 
addressed to him at the Arthur K. Watson computer sciences building at Yale 
University. It found the 40-year-old professor of computer science at an 
interesting time in his career. Gelernter has been consistently, almost 
arrogantly, extending the breadth of his writings beyond the technical, veering 
toward sociology, psychology, even Biblical studies. He is bracing now for the 
reaction to his latest book, 
&quot;1939,&quot; a study of that year's New York World's Fair, to be published next month. 
Gelernter thinks that event was important in part because it embodied what was 
then an overwhelmingly optimistic view of technology and the future. 
&quot;In 1939,&quot; he writes, 
&quot;technology was not remote and esoteric . . . its achievements were heroic.&quot; In contrast, Gelernter 
believes, it is now common to consider technology as an enemy. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The letter he received on April 24 was a grim confirmation of that observation. 
&quot;Dr. Gelernter,&quot; it began, 
&quot;People with advanced degrees aren't as smart as they think they are. If you'd 
had any brains you would have realized that there are a lot of people out there 
who resent bitterly the way techno-nerds like you are changing the world.&quot; It went on to blame computers for a litany of woes, including invasion of 
privacy, genetic engineering and 
&quot;environmental degradation through excessive economic growth.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The letter scornfully mentioned Gelernter's first book, 
&quot;Mirror Worlds,&quot; an optimistic view of the technological future. The developments Gelernter 
predicted, wrote the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> 
&quot;are inevitable only because techno-nerds like you make them inevitable. If 
there were no computer scientists there would be no progress in computer 
science.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The letter was among several 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> mailings that week. Two letters went to prominent Massachusetts scientists, 
Richard J. Roberts of New England Biolabs and Phillip A. Sharp of the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who shared the 1993 Nobel Prize in 
Medicine for their contributions to genetic research. Another parcel, opened by 
Gilbert B. Murray, a lobbyist for the California Forestry Association, was 
deadly. Murray was the unknown bomber's third fatality in 16 explosions, spaced 
over a 17-year period. Twenty-three people have been injured, 
some seriously.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">David Gelernter is among the latter. On the morning of June 24, 1993, just 
having completed a vacation, he hardly noticed an unfamiliar package with a 
Sacramento, Calif., return address. 
&quot;It was a package like millions of packages I've opened in the past,&quot; he recalls. Unlike all those other packages, however, this one contained a 
sophisticated explosive device, which detonated in his hands.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The blast shook the fifth floor of the Watson building, injured Gelernter 
severely and set his office on fire. Bleeding profusely, he dodged the flames, 
walked down five flights, cut through the parking lot and staggered up a small 
hill toward the university clinic. Once inside the clinic door, he collapsed. 
Doctors later told him that, had he dialed 911 and waited for help, he would 
not have survived.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">For the next several weeks, 
Gelernter had several operations, first to save his life and later to attempt 
to reconstruct shattered body parts. His lungs and other internal organs were 
damaged; his right ear required surgical repair. He lost almost all the vision 
in his right eye, and would eventually undergo a corneal transplant that 
restored partial vision. Some muscles in his right arm were lost forever. And 
most of his right hand was destroyed.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Sometime during these weeks, the F.B.I. informed him that he was the most 
recent prey of a terrorist who, since 1978, has engaged in a series of vicious 
mail bombings. Law-enforcement officials call him 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> because his earlier victims were associated with universities and airlines. In 
recent years he has expanded his interests to scientists, advertising 
executives and lobbyists. Two days before Gelernter became a victim, a 
geneticist at the University of California at 
San Francisco opened a parcel at his home and suffered similar, though less 
severe, injuries. On the day of Gelernter's injury, The New York Times received 
a letter from someone claiming to represent a group called 
&quot;FC&quot;; the letter promised both more bombs and an eventual explanation for them. The 
explanation finally came on April 24, when the Times received a lengthy missive 
from FC setting forth an anarchist agenda for 
&quot;the destruction of the worldwide industrial system.&quot; (Though the letters claim to originate from a group of terrorists, officials 
strongly believe the bombs are the work of a loner.)
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the summer of 1993, focusing on his own survival, David Gelernter could have 
not have cared less about FC, or even what the mysterious initials meant. 
Although his body was under reconstruction, as soon as his mind cleared 
Gelernter wanted to get back to work. 
&quot;That is David's characteristic behavior,&quot; says his editor, Susan Arellano. 
&quot;Very goal-driven, very clear and direct.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The doctor was worried that he was taking too much pain medicine,&quot; his wife, Jane Gelernter, says. 
&quot;He said that if someone gets overly reliant on the medication, he might never 
return to work. I told him: 'You're missing the point. He's taking the pain 
medication so he can do his work. He simply cannot turn off his brain.' 
&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the nearly two years since the bombing neither Gelernter's brain nor the 
body he has rehabilitated has slowed. He published one book, wrote another and 
reassumed his duties at Yale. He is now working on three new books. His agenda 
does not include looking back in anger. He never even read the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> note to him, sending it unopened to the F.B.I.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I made a point of 
not reading it,&quot; he explains. 
&quot;If this guy has a message for me I don't give a damn what it is.&quot; When he later heard that the day's mail had deadly consequences for yet 
another victim, he mourned quietly. But he refuses to dwell on the nature of 
the man who nearly killed him. 
&quot;I don't care what his motives are,&quot; says Gelernter. 
&quot;I'm not willing to describe him as insane, either, merely as evil in the 
unreconstructed sense.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Says David's father, Herbert Gelernter: 
&quot;There aren't many people who could go through what he did and be as he is. He 
has always been a very optimistic person. He won't let some nameless jerk stop 
his career.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">TODAY, THE ONLY OBVIOUS REMINDER OF THE day Gelernter 
&quot;got blown up,&quot; as he puts it, is a gauze-like glove around the remains of his right hand. We 
are in the living room of his house in a suburb of 
New Haven. There is a view of the surrounding woods. On the walls hang 
paintings (some done by Gelernter), posters and framed fragments of medieval 
manuscripts. The coffee table between two sofas is stacked with books -- 
novels, art catalogues, histories. Two lecterns hold thick dictionaries and 
other reference books. There is a piano that he played almost daily before he 
got blown up. He still composes music, although now he notes that musical 
imagery has dropped from his conversations. The piano serves as an easel for 
the paintings he has determinedly continued to produce, using a two-fisted 
approach that he has developed by necessity. Side by side are two pastels. One 
is a depiction of Fiorello La Guardia. The other is a self-portrait -- also 
easily identifiable (the round face, the scraggly beard, the severe wire-rims) 
but notable 
for a pensive quality not present in the physical Gelernter, who is an engaging 
and restless conversationalist.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In short, the contents of the room are ample evidence that Gelernter is 
anything but the smug 
&quot;techno-nerd&quot; imagined by his would-be destroyer. In fact, Gelernter professes ambivalence 
about computers, and considers himself as much a humanist as anything else. 
&quot;I have a lot of respect for computer science and for computer scientists,&quot; he explains. 
&quot;I'm happy in the field. But it would just be untenable to be a full-time 
computer scientist and not do other things. That would be an intellectual death 
sentence for me.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The struggle to combine computers with 
&quot;other things&quot; -- the arts, the humanities, religious studies -- began early for Gelernter. 
His father was a scientist at I.B.M. and a pioneer in the field of artificial 
intelligence. David 
himself enjoyed computers and mathematics but loved the arts as well. And 
following the example of his maternal grandfather, a respected rabbi, he also 
was drawn to Jewish scholarship.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He entered Yale in 1972, intending to concentrate almost entirely on the 
sciences. 
&quot;I never took an English course at Yale, because I had the undergraduate 
chutzpah point of view that I didn't want anybody at Yale telling me how to 
read Wordsworth, because I could bloody well read Wordsworth better than 
anybody.&quot; But he became drawn to religious studies. He still took courses in the 
sciences, and he was particularly inspired by a computer course in his junior 
year. Nonetheless, in 1976, after graduating with a B.A. in religious studies, 
he entered Yale's doctoral program in the same department. A year later, he 
left Yale to study 
Talmud in a Manhattan yeshiva.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The pendulum soon swung back, mainly because 
&quot;I was worried about how I was ever going to make a living,&quot; he admits. He entered the graduate program at the State University of New York 
at Stony Brook, where his father was then a professor. Gelernter's preference 
was to work in artificial intelligence, but pursuing this at Stony Brook would 
have meant having his father as an adviser. So he joined another group, which 
was working on a strange, though much talked-about, concept in computer 
science: a machine with multiple processors, all operating at the same time. 
The idea fascinated Gelernter.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;From the very first, parallelism seemed to me a powerful conceptual tool -- it 
is always the way that hard problems are solved,&quot; he says. 
&quot;That is, it's always the natural human response to a difficult problem. If you 
want to 
build a house, it's better to have a whole bunch of guys working simultaneously 
than to have one guy working serially.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But no one had figured out how to institute parallelism effectively. One 
approach was to assign pieces of a task to the individual processors, as if 
they were farm workers getting assignments to pick certain rows of 
strawberries. This courted inefficiency, since some processors might complete 
their tasks and have nothing left to do while some were still completing the 
equivalent of a long strawberry row. Other solutions allowed for communication 
between the processors by complicated 
&quot;message-passing&quot; schemes. While this kept the processors busy, it added a layer of complexity.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Gelernter invented a new language for parallel processing, one that allowed the 
processors to simultaneously harvest a single area in the computer memory. You 
can 
picture this area, called the tuple-space (the term is derived from the suffix 
in words like quintuple, sextuple), as sort of an information commons. 
Individual processors cruise the space looking for tuples -- data chunks in 
need of computation. They process the chunks and come back for more. The 
program stops running when all the chunks have been chosen and the calculations 
completed.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Collaborating with a graduate student, Nick Carriero, Gelernter got his system 
to work, and people were impressed. Eventually the time came to name this new 
computer language. The Defense Department had recently dubbed a language Ada, 
in honor of Ada Lovelace, the daughter of Lord Byron, who supposedly wrote 
programs for Charles Babbage's fabled Analytical Engine. So Gelernter, with an 
insouciance he now regrets, also chose a Lovelace as a namesake -- Linda, the 
lead actress 
in 
&quot;Deep Throat.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The extraordinary success of Linda and an offshoot, called Piranha, has helped 
make Gelernter a brand name in computer science, and he has capitalized on it. 
He and Carriero wrote a textbook on parallel programming, and Gelernter 
published his own book on what he considered the most significant offshoot of 
all that computer power -- what he calls mirror worlds. He describes them as 
&quot;software models of some chunk of reality, some piece of the real world going on 
outside your window . . . scooping up so much information that the model can 
mimic the reality's every move, moment by moment.&quot; He takes pains to differentiate this from virtual reality. 
&quot;It's a little hard to conceive of in engineering terms, but it's supposed to 
mirror reality rather than being a sort of parallel reality or cyberworld as 
distinct from the regular 
world. The whole point of a mirror world is that it's wired in real time and 
place.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In other words, a surrogate that, when tweaked, yields consequences in the 
original. Just as when you stick a pin into a voodoo doll, the real-life person 
lets out a yelp. A relatively modest example would be a mirror world of a 
hospital that not only maintained the duty roster (past, present and future) 
but monitored the status and medical history of every patient. If someone 
doesn't give Mr. Johnson his medication, the mirror world will take notice and 
alert a human nurse. Eventually, we will see mirror worlds of entire cities, 
and people will be able to conduct a lot of their activities simply by 
interacting through the mirror world.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Mirror Worlds&quot; is written in a 
punchy urban vernacular spiked with flat proclamations. 
&quot;Mirror worlds mark a new era in mankind's relationship to the man-made world,&quot; is the conclusion. 
&quot;They change that relationship for good.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">It is this assertion that apparently incited the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> -- but in conversation, Gelernter turns out to have considerable reservations 
about computers. Yes, he likes them and understands them, but his relationship 
with them is a rocky one.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;David as a general rule doesn't like computers all that much,&quot; explains Nick Carriero. 
&quot;He finds them disappointing in some sense. He has a strong internal image of 
what they could be, what they should be, what he wants them to be. But they 
never seem to live up to that image.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">DAVID GELERNTER'S OFFICE IN WATSON HALL, unlike his home, reflects the 
scientific, logical component of his nature. It is almost a hacker's lair. 
Nothing hangs on the walls, though a stained-glass 
Hebrew chai leans against the window. The furniture is institutional -- a sofa, 
a table that does for a desk but is actually so covered with papers, manuals, 
magazines and books that it is more a stockpile than a work space. The overflow 
has wound up on the floor. Stacked almost ceiling high are towers of blue 
plastic milk cartons filled with files and papers, some of them severely 
charred by the Unabomb explosion. Strewn around the room are empty cans of Diet 
Sprite. Overseeing the rubble from the back of the room are the unblinking 
monitors of a Sun work station and a Macintosh II.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Gelernter now drives to work, a quietly triumphant result of his lengthy 
rehabilitation. He is emphatic that he not be seen as a victim. Only when 
prodded will he enumerate the extent of his injuries. The major one is the 
disfigurement of his right hand. 
&quot;After the second 
major operation, an all-day thing, the surgeon was very enthusiastic,&quot; says Gelernter. 
&quot;At the time, I didn't quite see what he was so excited about. I said, 'So I 
have a piece of hand, what the hell good is that?' Now, I more properly 
appreciate that -- it's a lot better than having nothing.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Gelernter does say that a single silver lining has emerged from this incident: 
an indelible realization that anything worth doing should be done immediately. 
He says this epiphany gave him the courage to embark on 
&quot;1939,&quot; which he took up immediately after finishing the risky and harshly criticized 
&quot;The Muse in the Machine,&quot; a book he was working on before the bombing. In it he had postulated a theory 
of creativity based on the degree to which people focus their attention. 
&quot;High focus,&quot; or direct concentration on a problem, is useful but doesn't 
yield innovations, Gelernter says. These come in moments of 
&quot;low focus,&quot; when attention is wandering or emotions interfere with rationality. That 
insight, he thought, might be useful in making computers come up with original 
ideas: if we give them emotions and let their artificial minds ramble, they 
might surprise us.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">With a few exceptions, the response was unenthusiastic. The psychologist Stuart 
Sutherland, writing in Nature, simply called the theory wrong. Steven Pinker, 
director of the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience at M.I.T., also dismissed it. 
&quot;Gelernter assumes that creativity comes from this low-focus daydreaming state,&quot; he says. 
&quot;It makes a great story, but if you look at the contemporary records and 
autobiographies, it doesn't work that way.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Undaunted -- and emboldened by his close brush with death -- Gelernter is not 
playing it safe with another computer book. Instead, he has written 
a book that combines history, social commentary and even some fantasy in the 
form of an imaginary framing narrative that at times threatens to overwhelm the 
book -- or turn it into fiction. 
&quot;I'm comfortable calling it history,&quot; says Gelernter. 
&quot;But you might call it a novel with an index.&quot; The main character is the 1939 World's Fair, which he considers the most 
significant exposition ever held.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Gelernter intends to deliver a moral message, too. Not many people would argue 
with his opening insight -- that in 1939 people attending the World's Fair 
gobbled up the optimistic view of the future offered in Flushing Meadows, while 
people now, in much palmier times than in the late Depression, with World War 
II looming, are generally pessimistic. How did we lose the future? Gelernter's 
answer may raise some eyebrows. He 
believes that the United States realized the fair's predictions of a 
technological and economic utopia -- and the country subsequently imploded with 
its own success.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;We don't have a direction anymore, because we've gotten where American society 
was supposed to go,&quot; he says. 
&quot;We stopped driving forward because we had no place else to drive. The American 
dream was a good life for the middle class and the working class. You didn't 
have to worry about where your next meal was coming from, you didn't have to 
worry about starving in your old age, you could afford a car, you had such a 
thing as a vacation.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;When can it ever be said before that society mapped out a goal and over a 
period of decades actually achieved it? It's never happened on the scale that 
it's happened in this country, and when you look at the processes that have 
accompanied our reaching the goal, you are reminded again and again of the 
second 
law of thermodynamics in the sense that the entropy of American society has 
increased enormously, and we can't put things back together again.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">THOUGH GELERNTER INSISTS THAT LIFE IN 1995 is overall far superior to life 56 
years ago, his descriptions of the fair and its time are intensely nostalgic 
(interesting, considering that the author was not born until over a decade of 
dust had settled on the Trylon and Perisphere). What Gelernter seems to miss 
most is the well-behaved nature of the citizenry. He yearns for the days when 
people, for reasons of the commonweal, did what they were told. He is endlessly 
impressed that pictures of the fair depict almost all the males, even boys, 
wearing ties, and the women in dresses.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">It was an 
&quot;ought culture,&quot; he says, 
&quot;where the idea of doing as you ought was an ever-present superego.&quot; The concept that people should simply do what they wanted to do was unheard 
of. There were rules for everything, from sex and divorce down to the 
most insignificant social gestures -- rules of etiquette, complex styles of 
dress, elaborate protocols of service between yourself and a gas station 
attendant or a porter on the train. People could and did flout these rules, but 
there were prices to pay. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;A society with some notion of authority, where children had respect for 
policemen, let's say, or for a teacher, was probably not such a bad thing to 
have,&quot; he says. 
&quot;I think we realize now that a society in which civility was valued as an 
attribute had some important advantages. I think it's clear that people had 
much higher expectations for what society would deliver to them. Certain social 
values that we believe are important thrived in 1939, and are on the rocks 
today.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Gelernter's views on the sorry disintegration of the 
&quot;ought culture&quot; place him in the unlikely company of right-wing commentators like Alan 
Bloom and William Bennett. (He calls himself a Roosevelt Democrat with a 
conservative streak -- 
&quot;in other words, a Republican,&quot; he says.) Yet he cannot hide the fact that he is indignant, if not outraged, 
about the decline of American civilization, and particularly concerned with the 
effect of crime. And this feeling antedated his getting blown up.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Street crime and burglaries in New Haven were a factor in his reluctant move to 
the suburbs. And not long ago, in support of law-enforcement authorities, 
Gelernter wrote an Op-Ed piece in favor of the Clinton Administration's 
proposed 
&quot;Clipper Chip&quot; (which would enable the Government, under certain conditions, to eavesdrop on 
digitally scrambled telephone conversations). It took some guts to write this, 
since the digital community loathes Clipper as a gross invasion of privacy.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Sure enough, Gelernter's E-mail was 
full of flaming rejoinders. Reading them was a sobering experience; it 
convinced him that even the most technologically literate people in the country 
are, in a profound sense, uninformed. Most of all, he bemoans, they know 
nothing of history. He thinks it bodes ill for the most eagerly awaited public 
works project in the information age.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The information highway is going to be planned and built by obsessive software 
builders who are tremendously valuable in their productivity,&quot; he says. 
&quot;But I'm suspicious of them as a group. Their push is to build software. I have 
a push to read Keats and I don't think they read Keats. I think schools today 
are so lousy that people can graduate from high school and graduate from 
college and never have heard of Keats, and I think those are the wrong 
individuals to build public works.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;In those messages I 
see assertions about McCarthy, for example, or about Nixon, or about the nature 
of the United States political system, that are wildly naive. These people 
never read 10 pages about what the McCarthy era was like! These are people who 
don't have any conception of the development of the American political 
tradition. And I think that when you do something in the public sphere, it 
behooves you to know something about what the public sphere is like. How did 
this country get this way? What was the history of the relationship between 
technology and the public? What's the history of political exchange? The 
problem is, hackers don't tend to know any of that. And that's why it worries 
me to have these people in charge of public policy. Not because they're bad, 
just because they're uneducated.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Confronting this sort of ignorance increases the urgency with which Gelernter 
broadcasts his message in 
&quot;1939.&quot; Early in the book, he writes of a speech that would occur in the waning days 
of the fair's 
second season -- Winston Churchill's rallying cry to 
&quot;fight on the beaches&quot; to defeat the Nazi threat. Gelernter calls these the 
&quot;most memorable and defining words of the 20th century.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">It pains him that some younger people hardly know who Winston Churchill is. And 
he's even more uncomfortable to find himself identified more with the 
technocrats than with the humanists. But that is the paradox of Gelernter: an 
arts-and-religion person who finds himself an avatar of the digital age, where 
expression resides not in poetry or metaphor but strings of ones and zeros that 
can be permanently wiped off the face of the earth by a single stroke of a 
keyboard. Digits are ephemeral but sonnets, paintings, scenes from our 
childhood, scents of a summer evening and the images of history lodge in the 
mind. Gelernter believes that computers and their mirror-world capabilities 
will usher in a 
Renaissance of the human spirit. At the same time, he sees our current society, 
where computers are ascendant, as lacking authority. The resulting ignorance 
and lack of direction could lead us to abuse our technical skills and install a 
digital infrastructure that oppresses rather than nourishes.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">For most of us, the pessimistic vision is the more convincing one. After all, 
we need look no further than Gelernter's shattered hand and snaking scars, grim 
evidence of the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> mastery of technology. But David Gelernter presses towards the sunny side. 
Knowledge and understanding can overwhelm the dark side, he believes. And 
history, rather than dampen our aspirations, can inspire us to exceed our 
limitations. He does not have to stray far to cite an example: his own 
experience, on the day he got blown up. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;It seemed to me my minutes were numbered, and I needed something to help me 
concentrate and make 
it possible to get to the hospital. This building is not very far from the one 
across the street, but it seemed like a very long walk at the time. I was 
mainly thinking about Jane and my two children, but then my mind came up with 
something appropriate for the circumstance.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I had been in Israel a few weeks before and driven with a colleague and her 
father from a rural kibbutz into Jerusalem, through a mountainous area. And my 
friend's father was talking about the War of Independence. He was a person like 
many people I know and respect, a scholarly, thoughtful, philosophical sort of 
guy. I was struck that people like him had picked up rifles and fought. And so, 
as I was dragging myself over to the clinic, I recalled a Zionist song from 
that time called 'March of the Palmach,' playing 
it in my head along with this image of the struggle for the hills of Jerusalem.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">It was this song that accompanied David Gelernter down five flights of steps 
and across the street to the clinic. And the experience obviously infused the 
tone of 
&quot;1939.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Says Gelernter: 
&quot;Granted, most people will never be in a situation like that. But when you 
deprive people of history, you deprive them of something that has real value. 
It used to be regarded as obvious that you studied history to build your 
character. You studied the lives of famous men and thereby you learned to 
behave yourself.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;You became a better person. We now regard this attitude as a sort of Victorian 
mustiness. But I think it's true, and have experienced it, in a literal sense. 
History isn't just an intellectual pursuit. It can literally be a life-saving 
inspiration.&quot;
