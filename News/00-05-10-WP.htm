Have Struck a Nerve 







</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> John Schwartz, Washington Post Staff Writer 







</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>

 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">It was a Paul on the Damascus Road conversion, Internet style. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">Clifford Stoll, one of America's most renowned computer fanatics, had had 

enough.  



</p><p class="body" align="Left">He was vacationing on a Connecticut farm with friends. The others were 

chatting, stargazing and enjoying bites of buttered popcorn. Meanwhile, 

&quot;I'm bathed in the cold glow of my cathode-ray tube, answering e-mail.&quot; Instead of bantering with his friends, he's reading banter on-line, 

corresponding with a lot of people he doesn't really know.  



</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I see my reflection in the screen and a chill runs down my spine. Even on 

vacation, I can't escape the computer networks. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I take a deep breath and pull the plug.&quot; 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">So begins 

&quot;Silicon Snake Oil: Second Thoughts on the Information Highway,&quot; Stoll's second book, which has created a stir and landed on some bestseller 

lists because it says that the Internet is -- zooks! -- overhyped by fast-buck 

businessmen and 

&quot;technoburbling&quot; journalists. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">Few people have more impressive credentials to trash the Internet than Stoll: 

The astronomer turned computer security expert caught German hackers searching 

for U.S. military secrets to sell to the Soviets; he tracked them across the 

global network of computer networks and wrote it all up in a surprise 1989 

bestseller, 

&quot;The Cuckoo's Egg.&quot; The book was such 

a hit that PBS turned it into a 

&quot;Nova&quot; episode; Stoll played himself. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">In this world, he's about as much of an old-timer as one gets, having spent 

more than 15 years with the Internet. They grew up together. But recent 

rhapsodizing about the digital future leaves him cold: 

&quot;I hear so much positive about the Internet, I think it's time for someone to 

raise a flag.&quot; 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">Stoll's moment of truth probably didn't happen the way he recalls, though. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">It doesn't seem like him because the passage does not mention any whooping or 

jumping. Whooping and jumping are the essence of all-encompassing, goofballish 

CliffStollery. When he gets going, the wiry 44-year-old Stoll seems constantly 

to be in motion, his hands fling-gesturing, his frizzy penumbra of hair 

following the rhythm of his gimbaling head, his whole 

body leaping up and down to put a few hundred exclamation marks at the end of a 

sentence, a personal gestalt that screams RITALIN! GIVE HIM RITALIN! 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">His manner impresses the blazes out of small children, who recognize him as one 

of their own. He says stuff like 

&quot;zooks!&quot; and 

&quot;hot ziggity!&quot; He ends phone messages with 

&quot;Smiles to ya!&quot; He excitedly shows off toys he's picked up in science museums; words and 

explanations excitedly gush out of him as if he's some kind of knowledge 

blender and somebody left the top off. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">Stoll visits the offices of The Washington Post. He doesn't just sit in a 

reporter's chair -- he fiddles and futzes with its ergonomic controls, zipping 

it up and down like a barber's chair and bouncing on its cushioned seat. 

Meeting one science reporter, he excitedly expresses his admiration for her 

work. She flashes Stoll a classic fear smile and edges back to her day's story. 

Stoll excuses himself and heads off to the bathroom, and another reporter who 

has been quietly taking in the scene turns, shoots a look over the top of his 

glasses and asks, deadpan: 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;. . . Computer guy?&quot; 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">Unmistakably. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">Cliff Stoll, Radar Ranger 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">While Stoll has won the hearts of Luddites everywhere with 

&quot;Silicon Snake Oil,&quot; he's no literary 

<strong>Unabomber</strong> plotting darkly against the 

&quot;techno-nerds.&quot; He doesn't hate technology, or even the Internet. He didn't even actually 

&quot;pull the plug&quot; back there on that farmland vacation: You can still reach him via e-mail, 

though he prefers that you write or phone. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">That's the big Stollian secret: This quintessential Bay Area techno-hippie 

still loves technology, as long as it adds to life instead of detracting from 

it. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">A 

while back he got angry at the drivers speeding through his neighborhood and 

decided he'd figure out just how fast they were going. He pulled down some 

books and built himself a radar gun -- like the ones the cops use, but 

home-brewed largely out of spare parts and coffee cans. He then jacked the 

ungainly device into his computer and threw the data into a spreadsheet so he 

could measure the speed of every car passing in front of his house and chart 

the results -- bell curves of velocity with means and modes calculated out into 

decimal heaven. He gave the resulting evidence to other folks in the 

neighborhood, who in turn put pressure on the cash-strapped City Council for a 

little relief. 

&quot;It turns out we got our speed bumps and I met my neighbors!&quot; 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">Nerd citizen; 

nerd hero. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">Technology, however, can't fix many of the problems it's being touted as a 

panacea for, he's concluded. The shared techno-visions of Vice President Gore 

and House Speaker Newt Gingrich of an enhanced democratic process thanks to the 

wiring of America? 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Bogus.&quot; 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">The promise of better education and tighter communities ushered in by high-tech 

is, he states flatly over coffee, 

&quot;a baldfaced lie -- it's bogus!&quot; The key to education, he contends, is totally jazzed teachers, not expensive 

new edu-toys; he underscores the point by recalling the filmstrips he was 

forced to watch in junior high school. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">He's not simply anti-; call Cliff Stoll an ambi, working through a 

self-described 

&quot;perplexed ambivalence.&quot; He says, 

&quot;I have many different feelings, ranging from 'I love this Net!' to 'I hate this 

Net!' 

&quot; 

Stoll has taken his emotional gumbo and put it to paper, a 234-page therapy 

session that he has gotten Doubleday -- and his readers -- to pay for. This is 

indeed a great country. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">His conclusion, boiled down to a sound bite: 

&quot;Real life and authentic experience mean much more than anything the modem can 

deliver.&quot; 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I love technology. I love computers. It's the cult of computing that bothers 

me; it's the alienation of it.&quot; 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">Alienation. The book, and the quest, are not so much about the Internet as 

about Stoll himself. He's not asking what's wrong with technology -- he's 

asking what's wrong with us, that we would look to silicon and plastic for our 

answers. Stoll is wondering aloud about the best ways for us to connect with 

one another. Such connections are rare enough in person; the computer adds a 

layer of interference that we can do without, he's come to feel. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I 

suspect these interactions are mostly shallow and ephemeral,&quot; he writes. 

&quot;Computer games develop skills without fostering friendships. Multimedia 

extravaganzas impress but rarely satisfy. There's no there there,&quot; the Oakland resident writes. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">Having seen himself drain away the days of his life through a screen, he now 

stands at the edge of the precipice, waving the rest of us away. 

&quot;It's people talking, not doing.&quot; Don't give yourself over completely to the virtual world. Dig in a garden; 

bake brownies. (He helpfully supplies a recipe in the book.) Make your own 

radar detector, even. That, too, is living: At its best, Radio Shack can be 

another garden to get your fingernails dirty in. Get a life, he pleads. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">Is this a prescription or a confession? Stoll is a guy who, while warm and 

engaging, at 

times seems to be merely visiting our planet. In the middle of 

&quot;Cuckoo's Egg,&quot; he digresses to tell about the time he needed to dry off his one pair of shoes 

before dinner and so popped them into his roommate's new microwave oven and 

turned it on. Then the phone rings. It's his then-girlfriend (now ex-wife; he 

has since remarried and has a baby daughter). 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Suppose I want to dry out my sneakers,&quot; I said. 

&quot;What should I set on the microwave?&quot; 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Be serious.&quot; 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I am being serious. My sneakers are wet.&quot; 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Don't you dare put them in the microwave.&quot; 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Well, theoretically speaking, how long should I hypothetically set the 

microwave for?&quot; 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">As this conversation goes on, of course, the microwave dings. Done. The guy who 

can track computer hackers and perform astrophysical calculations finds that 

the new microwave oven is belching 

&quot;an 

angry cloud of thick, black smoke. The kind you see in newsreels, when the oil 

refinery blows up. And the stench -- it smelled like an old tire burning. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I swung open the microwave, and another cloud of smoke belched out. I reached 

in and tried pulling out the sneakers -- they still looked like sneakers, but 

had the texture of hot mozzarella cheese. I tossed them and the glass tray out 

of the kitchen window. The tray shattered in the driveway, and the smoldering 

sneakers lay seething next to the plum tree.&quot; 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">Things go from bad to hilarious: He tries to clean the microwave, walls and 

ceiling, but just smears the soot around. He tries to drive out the smell by 

boiling vanilla on the stove. 

&quot;The kitchen no longer smells like a burning old blackwall tire. No, now it 

smells like a burning new whitewall tire.&quot; The pot of vanilla scorches. With his girlfriend's arrival imminent, he tries 

to slap some cookies into the oven as a preemptive peace offering. 

&quot;Well, a third of the cookies slid off the pan and stuck on the bottom of the 

oven where they turn to cinders.&quot; And on and on. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Cuckoo's Egg&quot; was a great yarn; 

&quot;Snake Oil&quot; is a manifesto. It comes at a propitious time; the on-line world has been 

hyped beyond recognition. Most Americans are already deeply sick of buzzwords 

they still don't understand. Why in the world are our newspapers and 

newsweeklies printing 

&quot;universal resource locators&quot; -- those gibberish codes http://www. ncsa.uiuc.edu/scms/Metascience/ 

Home/welcome.html that lead computer users to particular sites on the Internet? 

Why do we get stories about every twist and turn of the 

information superhighway when steel-and-concrete highways are crumbling? Why in 

God's name is Bill Gates a celebrity? 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">His distaste for hype comes naturally and honestly. Stoll cares deeply about 

relationships, and about loyalty -- sometimes, to extremes. Offered a drink, he 

asks, 

&quot;Do you want to hear a story?&quot; Turns out his father was drinking a beer once and young Stoll asks for a 

taste. His father smiled and said, 

&quot;Later. When you're older.&quot; A few years later, the same beverage, the same question, the same answer. His 

father has long since died, but Cliff Stoll is waiting: 

&quot;I still have never drunk alcohol.&quot; 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">His Internet warning message, predictably, is not popular among those who spend 

their days and nights reaching out into the ether for information, 

companionship and argument. They strongly believe that any lack of 

contact with humanity is inside Stoll's head, not inside their computers. The 

Internet apostate gets his share of vituperative postings and hate mail, the 

angry calls to his home (well, he told everyone from newspaper reporters to the 

people who send him e-mail that his number is listed in the Oakland phone 

book). 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I've seen about a half-dozen&quot; of the flames, he says. 

&quot;Pretty nasty stuff. It's not surprising -- the Internet is the land of the rude.&quot; 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">Take this posting by Colorado-based electronic activist Dave Hughes on the 

WELL, an on-line service that has been a longtime Stollhangout. Hughes called 

the book 

&quot;a Hamletesque performance&quot; that was full of 

&quot;pure and intentional exaggeration&quot; and growled, 

&quot;I won't cut Stoll one inch. I can't stand a con man. Especially ones calling 

others Snake Oil salesmen.&quot; 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">That's 

not the universal cyberspace reaction, though -- especially among the Net-heads 

who have known Stoll for many of the 15 years he's been on-line. Fans of 

&quot;Cuckoo's Egg&quot; and his techno-buddies may disagree with him, but they generally cut him the 

kind of slack doled out to wayward friends. They argue that puppy-charming 

Stoll is simply preaching moderation, and he's really just combating the hype, 

and, you know, it's Cliff. The traitor as mascot. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;After all,&quot; says a friend, 

&quot;nobody has sweated more blood to make the Net a special place.&quot;
