</p><p class="body" align="Left">Washington - Possibly jealous of the publicity surrounding the Oklahoma City 
outrage, the serial mailbomber who has eluded US investigators for 17 years has 
sent letters to several previous victims and the New York Times newspaper, 
writes Rupert Cornwell .  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The letters appear to have been posted from Oakland, California, at much the 
same time as the explosive device which killed a Sacramento timber industry 
executive on Monday - the third death in 16 attacks since 1978 by the 
individual the FBI know simply as 
&quot;<strong>Unabomber&quot;</strong>: 22 other people have been injured by bombs attributed to him.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Although the letters purport to be the work of an 
&quot;anarchist&quot; belonging to the 
&quot;terrorist group FC&quot;, and refer throughout as 
&quot;we&quot;, they have given the clearest clue yet to his motives.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The pattern of the bombings has suggested a fanatical environmentalist or 
health activist, perhaps with a grudge against universities. But the rambling 
2,000-word letter, published by the Times, said 
&quot;the people we are out to get&quot; are scientists and engineers, especially in computers and genetics. The author 
has 
&quot;nothing against universities or scholars as such&quot;, but acknowledges FC's goal is to 
&quot;eliminate industrial society&quot;.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
&quot;<strong>Unabomber&quot;</strong> promises the attacks will stop for good if a far longer tract, between 29,000 
and 37,000 words, is published by the New York Times, Time, Newsweek, or 
another nation- ally distributed periodical. The letter also contained a nine- 
digit number used in a previous communication in 1993.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
Investigators believe 
&quot;<strong>Unabomber&quot;</strong> has only surfaced now because of resentment at the attention attracted by 
Oklahoma City. Police say the bomber has a bizarre fondness for wood, both to 
make his bombs and in his choice of victim - hence this week's mailbomb which 
killed Gilbert Murray of the California Forestry Association.
