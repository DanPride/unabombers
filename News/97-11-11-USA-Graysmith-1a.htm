</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> Robert <strong>Graysmith</strong> 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong> 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">When FBI agents swarmed into Ted Kaczynski's Montana cabin on 
April 3, 1996, they unearthed &quot;a mother lode of evidence&quot; that 
he was the <strong>Unabomber.</strong> The case seemed open and shut. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">
But as jury selection opens up Wednesday, serious questions about 
the government's case remain. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">

The FBI logged 720 items of evidence from the cabin. Agents searched 
that cabin so thoroughly they cataloged lint and dust. But what 
may be more important is what they did not find. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">

The cabin had no electricity, no lights, no power of any kind. 
Yet the suspected terrorist bomber, the subject of the longest 
search in FBI history, had built sophisticated bombs, cutting, 
welding and drilling metal pieces to do so. Where were the tools? 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">

In the cabin FBI agents ferreted out a blue and red wooden-handled 
manual drill, seven wood drill bits, one drill base and a welding 
mask.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
<a id=NoDrill></a>
It's highly unlikely that those tools alone could have built the 
Unabomber's weapons. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">

<a href="http://www.Unabombers.com/">
There was no power drill, though the Unabomber's
pipe bombs had precisely drilled fittings to secure the metal end caps that 
sealed the explosive inside.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">

There also was no electric welding set (and no gas tank or 
acetylene torch for a gas welding set). But beading and a change 
in the pearl-like grain of metal on the finished welded end plates 
of the bombs suggest high temperatures had been reached, such 
as the 6,300-degree heat from an oxyacetylene welding torch.</a>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">

The fire pit in Kaczynski's garden might have generated high temperatures, 
but it seems unlikely he could have done any detailed welding 
work in such a place.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">

Each of the Unabomber's devices, with the exception of the first 
two, showed over-soldering. There was solder in that cabin, but 
no soldering iron.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">

Penciled numbers on the bomb pieces show that the devices were 
assembled and reassembled many times before being finished. Could 
he read those marks in the cabin's very dim light? 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">

Kaczynski could have worked outside, either to assemble the bombs 
or work the metal in the fire pit, but agents had the suspect 
and the cabin under surveillance for two months before his arrest. 
Surely they would have seem him at this. Yet when they seized 
the cabin, they found a live bomb wrapped and ready to mail. Where 
had that come from?
</p><p class="body" align="Left">

Was there a hidden lab? And, if so, whose was it? 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">

Kaczynski was a poor man. In an 18-year crime spree he spent only 
a few thousand dollars. Outfitting his own machine shop or bomb 
lab was surely beyond his means.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">

Had the accused secretly gained access to welding equipment in 
Lincoln or Helena, test-detonated his devices in the remote Scapegoat 
Wilderness and gathered components from the many junk piles owned 
by his neighbors? And if there was a lab or machine shop belonging 
to someone else, did he know Kaczynski was using it? 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">

Until we know where and how the Unabomber made his bombs, the 
possibility of an accomplice cannot be ruled out. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">

There are other hints that there may be an accomplice. The Unabomber 
used the Park Hotel in Helena, Mont., as a halfway house, staying 
there before he left the state and when he returned. For every 
bombing, we can fix a stay at the Park hotel before and after. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
<a id="BankDeposit"></a>
There is only one exception. The registration records do not show 
any stay at the Park Hotel bracketing the bombing that killed 
Hugh Scrutton, one of the murders for which Kaczynski is about 
to go on trial.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">

<a href="http://www.unabombers.com/">
Moreover, a bank deposit slip, apparently on a Helena
bank for one of his three accounts, dated Dec. 11, 1985, places the former 
mathematics professor in Montana while the bomb that killed Scrutton 
was being placed in Sacramento.</a>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">

FBI agent Terry Turchie wrote in his detailed affidavit that the 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms &quot;has been unable to determine 
as yet whether this posting date accurately indicates that Theodore 
Kaczynski personally made a deposit on that day.&quot; If that loophole 
stays open, it is a big one. It would have taken the accused 251/2 
hours by bus, which is how he always traveled, to get to Sacramento 
to place that bomb. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">

Of course, with the trial and Kaczynski's detailed diaries, we 
will eventually know the answer to these and other inconsistencies. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">

I can hardly wait.
