</p><p class="body" align="Left">Washington - A lumber industry executive has been killed by a postal bomb in 
what the FBI says is probably the latest strike by the mysterious individual 
known as the 
&quot;<strong>Unabomber&quot;</strong>, writes Rupert Cornwell.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Gilbert Murray, president of the California Forestry Association, died when he 
opened a heavy package about the size of a shoe box delivered to the 
association's office in Sacramento on Monday.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> As always with 
&quot;<strong>Unabomber&quot;</strong>, the blast came without prior warning. Similarities with previous unexplained 
bombings, 15 since 1978 across the US, 
&quot;strongly suggest&quot; the Sacramento killing is the work of the same person, FBI special agent 
Richard Ross said, emphasising that there was no sign of any connection with 
the Oklahoma City attack.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Despite 17 years of pursuit, Bureau specialists have come up with only the 
haziest Identikit of their target, usually depicted as a white man in a ski hat 
and dark glasses. He is believed to be about 40, well educated, and clearly an 
expert in his field.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Mr Gilbert's death, coming four months after the murder of a New Jersey 
employee of an advertising agency working on pro-smoking issues, could mean the 
postal bomber is a pro-health and pro-environment fanatic.
