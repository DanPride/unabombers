<strong>Graysmith,</strong> whose books include 
&quot;Zodiac&quot; and 
&quot;The Sleeping Lady,&quot; has been working on a book about the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> for two years. 
&quot;I'm always fascinated with manhunts,&quot; the author says.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>Graysmith's</strong> agent, who doesn't want his name known because he doesn't want to play 
hide-and-seek with the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> is getting ready for a book auction. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>Graysmith</strong> is optimistic that the bomber will be caught soon. 
&quot;By the time 

we get this done,&quot; he said, 
&quot;they're going to have him.&quot;

Madonna intruder wounded by guard

A security guard shot a man who apparently scaled a fence to get into the 

back yard of Madonna's Hollywood Hills, Calif., home while the pop star was 

away.
Robert Roland Hoskins, 37, was shot three times in the arm and abdomen 

Monday evening, police said. He was in fair condition today.
&quot;There have been reports made by Madonna that he has been threatening her 

and stalking her,&quot; police Detective Mike McDonagh said.
Last summer, Todd Michael Lawrence, 26, a drifter from Arizona, was 

sentenced to a year in jail for scaling Madonna's fence. He claimed to be 

Madonna's husband.

Flowers learns about politics

Good news for these united states: 
Gennifer Flowers doesn't have her heart
set on being first lady, thank God.
&quot;There's such a tremendous responsibility, along with a marriage and 

children,&quot; says the self-proclaimed adulteress in Bill Clinton's alleged 

past. 
&quot;I'd rather sing in my nightclub and have a good time.&quot;
Flowers is touring to promote her autobiography, 
&quot;Passion and Betrayal.&quot;
She claims she and Clinton had a 12-year affair.

Flavor Flav latest rapper to go to jail

It's jail time: Flavor Flav, 36, the Public Enemy rapper with the big 

clock around his neck, was sentenced last week to three months for shooting at
a New York neighbor in November 1993.
The original charge, attempted murder, was reduced to a misdemeanor: weapon
possession. The rapper (a k a William Drayton) also got three years of 

probation and was ordered to enter drug rehab. </font></FORM>&nbsp;</body></html>
