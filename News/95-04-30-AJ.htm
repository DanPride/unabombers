The enemy that lurks within

The following editorial appeared Thursday in the Miami Herald. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">When a gang of Middle Eastern radicals bombed the World Trade Center in 1993, 
many Americans thought they had seen the ultimate enemy: ignorant foreign 
hatemongers.  
After the bombing in Oklahoma City, many people lurched toward the same theory, 
only to find that the suspected bombers were even scarier: ignorant American 
hate-mongers. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Now the nameless 
&quot;Unabom&quot; terrorist has sent The New York Times an informative, terrifying rebuke. 
&quot;Dear America,&quot; it says in effect, 
&quot;you still don't get it.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The contagious evil that the letter described - the deranged compulsion to 
write history in random fire and innocent blood - obviously knows no 
nationality, class or creed. Its disciples aren't necessarily ignorant. And its 
message isn't even necessarily about hate. It's a generalized ruthlessness 
built on a common mentality of siege and paranoia. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">With luck and patience, federal agents seem likely to crack the Oklahoma City 
case. With even more luck, they may someday catch the 
<strong>Unabomber.</strong> 
But the nature of these beasts suggests that the story still will not have 
ended. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The nameless dread - made up of the homespun ingredients of massive explosives, 
the aimless paranoia of a twisted age, a global network of extremist cliques, 
and the igniting force of America's recent taste for viciousness - won't be 
locked away so neatly or so soon. Somewhere, in your village or neighborhood, 
the next dark apostle waits with hideous patience for an unseen voice to call 
his name.
