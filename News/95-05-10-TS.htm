</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong> 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">WASHINGTON (CP) - The Reform party's immigration critic yesterday joined a 
rally on the steps of the U.S. Capitol, where U.S. politicians urged tighter 
controls against immigrants, one congressman accusing them of 
&quot;murdering our children.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast) also linked immigrants with violent crime, which 
he said is the top concern of Canadians and Americans. But he added he was not 
entirely comfortable with the content of some of the speeches. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">He blamed 
&quot;lawyers and elite politicians&quot; for hijacking immigration policy.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">But 
&quot;to say that all our children, all the murders taking place in a country, are a 
result of illegals, I think that's taking it too far.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Homes destroyed as tornadoes hit Illinois 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) - Tornadoes touched down across a wide swath of central 
and northern Illinois yesterday, flipping over big-rig trucks and destroying 
homes. It wasn't immediately clear how many people were hurt. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">As many as five tornadoes may have been on the ground at once, said Mark 
Metzger, a dispatcher with the Menard County sheriff's department. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Africans seek ouster of chief of health body 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">GENEVA (Reuter) - A group of African nations launched a bid yesterday to oust 
Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima from his job as head of the World Health Organization for 
remarks about the agency's African 
staff that have been seen as racist. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">U.N. officials said Zambia and Namibia introduced a resolution at the World 
Health Assembly, the WHO's governing body, that could force the Japanese 
official out of his post as early as next year. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">TV ban urged after Gandhi slur on show 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">NEW DELHI (Reuter) - Irate Indian lawmakers called for a broadcast ban on 
Rupert Murdoch's STAR TV yesterday as the furor mounted over a disparaging 
reference to Mohandas Gandhi on a television talk show. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Homosexual-rights activist Ashok Row-Kavi triggered the ruckus last week when 
he told the show's host, Nikki Bedi, host of the Hong Kong-based TV network's 
new chat show Nikki Tonight, that he once lost a job for calling the revered 
Indian leader a 
&quot;bastard.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Israel to expropriate more Palestinian land 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">JERUSALEM (AP) - Despite an outcry from the Arab world, Israel plans to 
expropriate hundreds more hectares of Palestinian-owned land in Jerusalem, the 
Israeli housing minister said in remarks published yesterday. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Benjamin Ben-Eliezer said Israel would confiscate more land as part of the 
&quot;battle for the future of Jerusalem.&quot; The Muslim militant group Hamas threatened new attacks on Israelis if more 
Arab land is taken.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">MIAMI (AP) - Over bitter protests from Cuban-Americans, the United States 
returned 13 Cuban boat people to their homeland yesterday, the first refugees 
to be sent back under a new policy announced last week that ended 35 years of 
open arms. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Cuban men, 
aged 28 to 45, were picked up from two wooden boats by a passing cruise ship 
near the Cayman Islands last Thursday. The Coast Guard left them off at Bahia 
de Cabanas, a Cuban naval base about 65 kilometres from Havana.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">BOSTON (Reuter) - The deadly 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> sent letters to two Nobel Prize-winning scientists in Massachusetts warning 
them to give up their work in genetics and computers, FBI officials and 
newspapers reported. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In a statement late Monday, the FBI said Richard Roberts, who is head of 
research for New England Biolabs in Beverly, Mass., had received one of four 
letters apparently sent by the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> April 20. The Boston Herald yesterday quoted unnamed sources as saying one of 
four letters was sent to Phillip Sharp, 51, head of the biology department at 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
