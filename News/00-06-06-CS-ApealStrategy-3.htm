<strong>HIGHLIGHT:</strong>
<strong>Unabomber</strong> Ted Kaczynski's appeal raises issue of whether a lawyer's obligation to save a 
client's life is paramount.  



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong> 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">When Theodore Kaczynski, the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> pled guilty to three murders in January 1998 and received a life sentence 
instead of the death penalty, it was widely considered a victory for his 
defense team.  


Yet Mr. Kaczynski is now trying to reverse the deal.  


In neatly lettered, handwritten court documents sent from his Florence, Colo., 
prison cell, he argues that he was coerced into the guilty plea by his 
court-appointed lawyers, who ignored his repeated statements that he preferred 
death over life imprisonment.  


&quot;The purpose of the present appeal is to challenge the district court's ruling 
that Kaczynski's guilty plea was voluntary,&quot; the former mathematics professor wrote in his recent brief to the appeals 
court.  


The case cuts to the heart of a prickly question in American jurisprudence: Who 
should direct the defense in a capital murder case? And should a client's 
wishes take precedence over an attorney's ethical obligations - even if those 
wishes are, as in Kaczynski's case, for execution?  


&quot;One of the reasons that the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> case is so significant is that this is terrain that really has not been mapped 
out,&quot; says Michael Mello, a Vermont Law School professor who has written a book 
about the case.  


Kaczynski says he was improperly prevented from directing his own defense, and 
that he took the plea bargain only to avoid a defense strategy that would have 
portrayed him as a 
&quot;grotesque lunatic.&quot; The Justice Department maintains that Kaczynski was fully aware of the 
consequences of his plea, and that it should stand.  


While the law clearly leaves certain decisions up to the defendant - such as 
whether to plead guilty or go to trial, whether to testify, and whether to 
appeal - most power of decisionmaking lies in the hands of the defense lawyer, 
who is professionally obliged to protect the accused.  


Some experts, however, question giving such authority to the lawyer.  


In Kaczynski's case, he 
&quot;wanted to avoid having his lawyers portray him to the court and to the world as 
a raving lunatic,&quot; says Mr. Mello. 
&quot;He agreed to [the guilty plea] only to avoid suffering something that for him 
would have been much worse.&quot; 


But many defense lawyers believe it's inappropriate - if not irresponsible - to 
allow a defendant to dictate strategy.  


&quot;The call for determining the strategy for a defense is ultimately the lawyer's,&quot; says Michael Katz, Colorado's federal public defender. 
&quot;You've got an obligation to protect your client.&quot; 


That obligation should hold firm, says Mr. Katz, even when a client, like 
Kaczynski, expresses an emphatic preference for execution. 
&quot;A 
defense lawyer cannot in good conscience aid the client in this way,&quot; he says.  


The debate over legal decisionmaking cannot be separatedfrom the overarching 
question of mental illness, which was a looming presence in the Kaczynski case. 
 


When lawyers represent clients with mental problems, they must assume a role of 
&quot;guardianship,&quot; says Stephen Bright, director of the Southern Center for Human Rights in 
Atlanta. It would be unconscionable to let a mentally ill client direct the 
defense, he says, 
&quot;like letting a child drive a car, or fly a plane.&quot; 


In Kaczynski's case, despite being diagnosed by a prison psychiatrist as a 
paranoid schizophrenic, he was deemed competent to stand trial. But many say 
the threshold is too low, since a defendant need only be deemed able to 
participate and aid in the 
defense.  


Still, Mello, who engaged in a year-long correspondence with Kaczynski, says 
that while Kaczynski is eccentric, it's uncertain whether the psychiatric 
assessment is inaccurate. Moreover, no one has challenged Kaczynski's 
competence to stand trial. In such cases, Mello believes a lawyer's ultimate 
responsibility is to respect a client's wishes.  


&quot;For me, the bottom line is that it's the client's crime, it's the client's 
trial, and it's the client's life,&quot; he says. 
&quot;And it ought to be the client's choice.&quot;
