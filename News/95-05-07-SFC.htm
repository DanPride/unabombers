</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
 A WORD IN DEFENSE OF MATRIX
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Editor -- As the San Francisco Police Department's project coordinator for the 
department's Matrix-Quality of Life Program, I feel compelled to respond to 
Supervisor Angela Alioto's comments in your feature story ''Liberal and Proud 
of It'' (Sunday, April 16).
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Although I'm sure well intentioned, Supervisor Alioto makes several misleading 
and grossly inaccurate statements.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Supervisor Alioto states that 20,000 out of 38,000 arrests were for four 
quality of life crimes: sleeping on the street between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.; 
covering oneself with a blanket or cardboard box; urinating in public; and 
blocking a doorway. These statements are totally inaccurate.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The law prohibiting sleeping between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. applies to public 
parks, not city streets. Out of thousands of 
enforcement actions, only 512, based on SFPD internal statistics, involve this 
offense.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Supervisor Alioto states covering oneself with a blanket or cardboard box is a 
crime. Wrong again. In fact, SFPD enforcement policies and directives 
specifically direct that the mere lying or sleeping on or in a bedroll, in and 
of itself, does not constitute a violation. However, more permanent lodging in 
public places or camping in parks are criminal offenses. SFPD enforcement 
totals for 647i Penal Code (lodging) and 3.12 Park Code (camping) from August 
of 1993 through February 1995 are approximately 773.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Supervisor Alioto lists blocking a doorway as a crime. Municipal Police Code 
Section 25 prohibits trespassing on private property without permission. SFPD 
has issued approximately 573 citations for violations of 25 MPC.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Regarding public urination: SFPD doesn't conduct rooftop 
surveillance to catch people urinating behind dumpsters in alleys. If 
individuals with total disregard for the rights, health and decency of others 
decide to expose themselves and urinate on a crowded street corner and the 
police make the observation, the chances are the individual will receive a 
citation. Approximately 724 such enforcement actions were taken for public 
urination and/or littering.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Together, illegal lodging, the two Park Code violations, 25 MPC violations, and 
public urination violations add up to 2,582. This is a far cry from 20,000. The 
remaining 35,759 arrests and citations were for miscellaneous felony crimes, 
felony narcotic offenses, vandalism, graffiti, trespassing (cites/arrests), 
drunk and disorderly conduct, drinking alcoholic beverages in public, 
willful/malicious obstruction of the streets/ sidewalks, aggressive panhandling 
and other misdemeanor violations.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Supervisor Alioto states that 
SFPD diverts officers' attention from serious crime to pursue sleeping 
violations.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mayor Jordan, the Police Commission and Chief of Police Anthony Ribera have 
made it perfectly clear that the control of serious crime is the department's 
number one priority. Unfortunately, quality of life enforcement remains a 
necessity in some areas.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Lastly, I would like to take this opportunity to explain that the department's 
Matrix-Quality of Life Program is not an anti-homeless program or an attempt to 
move homeless individuals out of the city or away from downtown. Rather, it is 
a program to enhance the quality of life for all people -- residents, visitors 
and homeless alike.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">As a result of Mayor Jordan's Matrix Program and the department's work, 
coordination and cooperation with other city departments, quality of life 
conditions are greatly improved in most neighborhoods. Conditions may 
not be perfect, but in Civic Center, Justin Herman Plaza, the Market Street 
corridor, the Mission Street corridor and many other areas they are greatly 
improved. This is validated by many merchants and residential associations all 
across town who are very supportive of Mayor Jordan's Matrix Program and the 
SFPD's Quality of Life Program.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">MCNAMARA'S COURAGE
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Editor -- Since it is rare for persons in high office to admit mistakes, it is 
sad to see so much criticism of Robert McNamara breaking silence about the Viet 
Nam war. It is understandable that there is anger about his involvement in the 
war per se, as that is a natural consequence of being accountable, but to be 
angry at him for speaking out itself is misguided.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Many are angry because they erroneously believe that we are close to having 
healed from the war, and that bringing it up only makes it worse. But the anger 
itself is a sign of how much pain is still there. Many mistake true healing for 
simply avoiding the topic. The truth is that the nation has backed away from 
finishing the healing process, as illustrated by the lack of a generally 
accepted story of what the Viet Nam war was about. An essential part of the 
healing yet to be done is for us as a nation (including the leaders still alive 
who started the war and carried it out) to confront the question of what it 
meant, and to have a vigorous, open-minded dialogue to produce a shared story.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">That healing is unfinished is also borne out by the fact that too many of the 
soldiers and the families of those who died still suffer.  Coming to a shared 
story about the war's meaning would make it easier 
for them to heal, because they would not have to hide their experience, but 
could be embraced by the country's squarely dealing with reality.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">I, too, wish that McNamara would have come out against the war as soon as he 
decided it was wrong. That would have been the right thing to do, and it would 
have had a powerful impact on the country, perhaps even leading to a quicker 
end. But it is better late than never, especially since McNamara stands 
uniquely alone as a responsible high official who is addressing the folly of 
that war.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">So it is McNamara's courage to admit the mistakes and take the heat that I 
respect. Would that more leaders follow his example. It could go a long way 
toward reducing the cynicism Americans have for government. It could also 
inspire us to take responsibility for our own actions, and to have compassion 
for others, for we are becoming lost in the seductive culture of blame and 
division. We 
don't need any more hatred.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">FAULTY LOGIC
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Editor -- It is with appalled disbelief that I have read the shrill cries from 
the left that Rush Limbaugh and his fellow talk-radio commentators are somehow 
responsible for the tragedy in Oklahoma City. President Clinton, idiots who 
write letters to your newspaper and illogical columnists such as Texas windbag 
Molly Ivins (published by the Chron with alarming regularity) have all made 
this absurd accusation. Ivins, in answer to the question of whether she thought 
hate radio contributed to the ''torn, tiny bodies in Oklahoma City,'' sums it 
up in her reply: ''I know they did.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Using this faulty logic, Greenpeace, the Sierra Club, the Wilderness Society, 
PETA and especially Earth First! are fully responsible for the actions of the 
mad 
<strong>Unabomber.</strong> Through their anti-industrial, anti-capitalist 
rhetoric, they have obviously incited this madman to take these drastic 
measures, and though the death toll is much less (so far), the victims are just 
as dead.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Of course I am being facetious in making this accusation; as a firm believer in 
free speech, I would never suggest the censorship of any views, no matter how 
abhorrent. While I share many of Mr.  Limbaugh's beliefs, I often find him to 
be a pompous, hypocritical windbag. While I agree with many of the principles 
of the environmental movement, I find their most extreme viewpoints 
(articulated in frightening detail by the 
<strong>Unabomber)</strong> to be absurd.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Quite simply, I find the complete silence from the left regarding the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> in light of their knee-jerk attacks on ''hate speech, hate radio and hate 
politics,'' to be deafening.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">SELLING PRODUCT
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Editor -- If Limbaugh and other hate-government talk show hosts insist their 
rhetoric did not inspire the Oklahoma bomb throwers, then what good is radio 
advertising?
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The whole point of these radio programs is to sell product, whether it's 
shampoo or philosophy. I'd like to hear from the sponsors: Are they getting 
their money's worth?
