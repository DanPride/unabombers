</p><p class="body" align="Left">He coulda been a goner
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Broadway opening of the $ 2.5 mil 
&quot;&quot;On the Waterfront''
was expected to go on as planned Monday night despite a heart
attack felling actor Jerry Grayson, 58, during the play's final
preview Sunday.  He was in stable condition Monday at St. Clare's
Hospital, where he was reported 
&quot;&quot;sitting up and joking. '' He was
to be replaced as a corrupt union boss's henchman by Robertson
Carricart, who stepped in Sunday.  Glenn Close (&quot;&quot;Sunset
Boulevard'') and Matthew Broderick (&quot;&quot;How to Succeed in Business
Without Trying'') were named Monday as best musical Broadway actors
by the Outer Critics Circle.  Best dramatic actors: Nathan Lane
(&quot;&quot;Love!  Valour!  Compassion! '') and Cherry Jones (&quot;&quot;The Heiress'').  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Terrence McNally (&quot;&quot;Love! '') won for best play and Andrew Lloyd
Webber (&quot;&quot;Sunset'') for best musical.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Bomber's Penthouse
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Bob Guccione, publisher of Penthouse and Omni mags, said
Monday in an open letter that he will print the manifesto of the
mysterious 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> 
&quot;&quot;in order to save lives. '' Last week the
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> whose bomb attacks date to 1978, killing three and
injuring 23, said in a letter to the New York Times that he'd end
his terror campaign if a major outlet published his 29,000-word
manifesto.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">They're both nuts
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The most attention-getting celeb at the annual White House
Correspondents dinner last weekend?  Tony Curtis, 69, and his
20-something, 6-foot-2, blond girlfriend, Jill Van Den Berg, in
skintight dress and steel-studded 
dog collar.  
&quot;&quot;We are an item,''
Curtis said.  
&quot;&quot;I'm really crazy-nuts about Jill.  I'm nuts about
her, and she's nuts about me. ''
 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Walesa 
&amp; Polish fleece
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Lech Walesa had a colorful way last weekend of declaring
himself a candidate to continue as Polish president.  Said he: 
&quot;&quot;I
am ready to be chief shepherd in the mountain hut known as Poland
for another term. ''
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Model behavior
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Victoria Zdrok, the Villanova law student who made $ 20,000 as
a Playboy playmate of the month last year, whines that she didn't
get the $ 100,000 playmate of the year because Hugh Hefner's wife,
Kim, thought the publisher nuzzled her.  Hefner insists Kim's
&quot;&quot;moment of jealousy'' had nothing to do with Zdrok losing the big
dough and a new car to TV's 
&quot;&quot;Price Is Right'' model Julie Cialini,
whom Zdrok says has a 
&quot;&quot;Mickey Mouse 
voice'' and is 
&quot;&quot;extremely
close'' to Kim.  Zdrok also notes that when she met Mikhail
Gorbachev -- they're both Ukrainians -- 
&quot;&quot;Raisa was so jealous. ''
 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Sticking to baths now
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Janet Leigh, sliced in the shower in the movie 
&quot;&quot;Psycho,'' is
out later this month with what's reputedly the first inside book on
the 1960 movie.  In 
&quot;&quot;Psycho: Behind the Scenes of the Classic
Thriller,'' the actress, now 67, says it took seven days to shoot
the 45-second shower scene.  
&quot;&quot;I wore a moleskin suit, and it was
very uncomfortable,'' she notes.  And, yes, the picture got to her.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;&quot;I take baths, only baths,'' Leigh says.  And if she's where only a
shower is available, 
&quot;&quot;I make sure the doors and windows are
locked, and I leave the bathroom door open and shower curtain
open. ''

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Books of kindness
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The American Booksellers Association has named its 1995 ABBY
winners, 
books of kindness that retailers love to recommend.  The
adult winner is 
&quot;&quot;Chicken Soup,'' a collection of inspirational
stories by Jack Canfield and Mark Victor Hansen; the children's
winner, Marcus Pfister's 
&quot;&quot;The Rainbow Fish,'' about a fish that
learns to share what it most treasures.
