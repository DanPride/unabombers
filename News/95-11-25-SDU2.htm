Snow delays opening of Yosemite roads 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK -- Yosemite's high-country roads won't be opened in time 
for the busy Memorial Day weekend because of heavy snow, park officials said 
yesterday. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Tioga and Glacier Point roads normally are opened by the end of May, but will 
remain closed at least until mid-June this year. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Road crews have been slowed by up to 16 feet of snow covering several layers of 
ice since they began plowing Tioga Road on April 17. Crews have been able to 
plow only 23 miles of the 47-mile road from Crane Flat gate to Tioga Pass, park 
officials said.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">And because of extremely wet soil conditions, campgrounds along Tioga and 
Glacier Point roads aren't expected to begin opening until late June or early 
July. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">FBI focuses on labs in hunt for 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> The search for the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> has the FBI questioning staff members and searching laboratories at colleges 
and universities throughout Northern California. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;These interviews are a logical outgrowth of previous interviews conducted 
within and around machine shops in the (San Francisco) Bay area,&quot; FBI spokesman George Grotz said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Two FBI agents interviewed school officials at the College of Marin's Kentfield 
and Indian Valley campuses May 17, and at Dominican College last Friday. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI said it was looking for possible suspects, including former students or 
employees who may have had access to chemicals in science 
labs or in machine and maintenance shops. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Since 1978, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> has killed three people and injured 23 with 16 explosive devices sent through 
the mail.  Nine of those bombs were aimed at universities. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Court takes dim view of anti-loitering law FRANCISCO -- A judge is about to 
pull the teeth from a city ordinance banning loitering within 30 feet of 
automatic teller machines. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The law making it illegal to linger for more than a minute near ATMs when 
customers are doing business was passed as Proposition J by the San Francisco 
electorate last June. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The test case pits the city against Lloyd Maxwell, 45, a homeless man who was 
arrested in the Tenderloin district Aug. 20 after he was observed seated near a 
Wells Fargo ATM, holding a paper 
cup. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Municipal Court Judge Wallace P. Douglas on Tuesday said that the ordinance, on 
its face, attempts to prohibit constitutionally protected activity such as 
speechmaking, voter registration or distributing leaflets. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">He declined to grant a demurrer sought by Maxwell's lawyer, Deputy Public 
Defender Grace Suarez, but strongly indicated that the ordinance needs more 
work. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Santa Clara yields, repeals smoking ban The city is repealing its tough 
anti-smoking law. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The City Council, bowing to restaurant owners who said the law hurt business, 
voted Tuesday to overturn the ordinance. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">But that doesn't mean you can light up anywhere.  A new state measure bans 
smoking in most commercial places but temporarily allows it in bars, and will 
replace the city law. Associated Press

blast, fire kill 3; girl survives 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">GRASS VALLEY -- A father and two children died when a fire raced through their 
trailer home.  Another youngster was in critical condition yesterday with 
third-degree burns on 85 percent of her body. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Nevada County sheriff's deputies said the fire broke out after an explosion 
tore apart the 25-foot travel trailer shortly before 11 p.m. Tuesday. Other 
houses in the area were shaken by the force of the blast, they said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The explosion was under investigation.  The victims were living in the trailer 
while their permanent home was being rebuilt.  Their names were withheld 
pending notification of relatives. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The children's mother wasn't home at the time of the explosion. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Officials at University Medical Center in Sacramento said the surviving child, 
an 8-year-old girl, was in critical condition in the hospital's burn unit.
