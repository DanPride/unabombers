</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> From Ben Macintyre in New York 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong> 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A PARCEL bomb that killed a prominent New York advertising executive on 
Saturday was the work of a deranged but calculating serial bomber who has 
murdered two people and injured 23 others over the past 16 years, according to 
the FBI. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Thomas Mosser, 50, executive vice-president of the advertising and 
communications agency Young 
&amp; Rubicam, was decapitated when he opened a small parcel packed with high 
explosives in the kitchen of his New Jersey home. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Forensic scientists say that the attack bears the marks of the individual 
dubbed the ''<strong>Unabomber'</strong>', who has carried out 14 similar bombings since 1978 and whose campaign 
against universities, airlines and other business corporations appears to be 
growing ever more violent and unpredictable. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> ''The components of the bomb, its construction, make us believe the bombs are 
linked,'' Barry Mawn, head of the FBI in Newark, said 
yesterday.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The FBI called the bomber in a report in the early 1990s ''one of the most 
creative and elusive bombers ever encountered''. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> American federal officials can only speculate about why Mr Mosser might have 
become the latest target of the ''<strong>Unabomber'</strong>', so called because of his earlier attacks on university and airline 
employees. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The bomber appears to be motivated by a loathing for modern technology and the 
FBI has suggested that the latest attack may be linked to Young 
&amp; Rubicam's recently forged relationship with two of America's biggest computer 
firms, Digital Equipment Corporation and the Xerox Corporation. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> A reward of $1 million (Pounds 640,000) has been offered for information 
leading to an arrest and the FBI has issued a broad profile of the ''<strong>Unabomber'</strong>' based on fragments of information gleaned from his earlier attacks and a 
single confirmed sighting in Salt Lake City 
in 1987. He is described as a white man in his late 30s or 40s, with a ruddy 
complexion and reddish-blond hair, who is familiar with university life. A man 
fitting that description was seen kneeling beside an object moments before it 
exploded.  The bomber's earliest victims were airline executives, but he then 
broadened his range of targets to include experts in computer science, genetics 
and psychology. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Between 1987 and last year the bombing campaign appeared to subside, but then 
in June last year The New York Times received a letter from ''an anarchist 
group calling ourselves FC'', which spoke of a ''newsworthy event''. Soon 
afterwards, two prominent scientists were seriously injured by almost identical 
bombs. Charles Epstein, a University of California-San Francisco geneticist, 
lost several fingers 
in an explosion on June 22 last year. Two days later, David Gelertner, a Yale 
computer scientist, was seriously injured by a letter bomb in his office. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The New York Times may itself provide another clue to the ''<strong>Unabomber's'</strong>' methods: four victims, including Mr Mosser, were cited in the newspaper as 
leaders in their various fields shortly before they were attacked. A week ago 
the newspaper said that Mr Mosser had been promoted to the post of general 
manager at Young 
&amp; Rubicam. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> A former journalist, Mr Mosser served for four years as a naval officer in 
Vietnam and was based in London as vice-chairman of Burson-Marsteller, the 
wholly owned public relations subsidiary of Young 
&amp; Rubicam, before joining the parent company in New York earlier this 
year. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The neatly wrapped package, about the size of hardback book and addressed to 
Mr Mosser, arrived at his mansion in Caldwell, New Jersey, last Friday. He was 
preparing to take his wife and their two children to buy a Christmas tree on 
Saturday when he opened the parcel, which exploded, blowing a large hole 
through the kitchen counter and killing him instantly. His wife and two 
children were elsewhere in the house at the time. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The bomber usually leaves the initials ''FC'' engraved on his bombs which may 
''stand for an obscene phrase belittling computers'', investigators say. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The bombs are meticulously assembled using components that are impossible to 
trace, such as string, glue and wood which is often lovingly polished to a high 
sheen. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Investigators believe that the bomber takes extraordinary pride in his 
murderous methods and is almost certainly working alone. ''If it is a 
protest, it is a private protest,'' Thomas Blomberg, a Florida State 
criminologist, said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Officials suspect that the bomber does not know his victims Mr Mosser, for 
instance, had no known occupational link to any of the other victims but rather 
is seeking to make some kind of symbolic statement, the nature of which they 
have been unable to pinpoint. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Faith Hochberg, US Attorney for Northern New Jersey, said: ''We are all today 
determined to end the death and destruction that these bombings have wrought.''
