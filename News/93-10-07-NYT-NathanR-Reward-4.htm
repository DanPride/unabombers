</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Unable to track down a serial bomber who has terrorized executives and college 
campuses for 15 years, Federal investigators today reached out to the public 
for help, disclosing a tantalizing clue and offering a $1 million reward.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bomber last struck in June after a six-year hiatus. He sent two 
innocent-looking parcels from Sacramento, Calif. When opened, they maimed a 
genetics scholar at the University of California at San Francisco and, two days 
later, a prominent computer science professor at Yale University in New Haven.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The authorities say the same bomber has sent 12 similar packages since 1978, 
killing one person and injuring 21. And they have little doubt, they said 
today, that he will strike again.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Although it is impossible to say when or where more explosive packages would be 
sent, the authorities are particularly concerned about the month of November. 
The bomber has occasionally sent packages around the anniversary dates of 
earlier bombings, and he has struck twice on Nov. 15.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In a clear sign that officials are frustrated that the case may have begun 
growing stale, investigators today made public new evidence in the hope that it 
might develop leads: a notation on material mailed by the bomber that the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation said was invisible to the eye and that 
investigators believe the bomber wrote. 
&quot;Call Nathan R wed 7 pm,&quot; it read. The F.B.I. released 
a depiction of the notation.

Discovery in June
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Officials declined to say where they had found the notation, although they 
said it was discovered in June shortly after the packages were opened by 
Professors David Gelernter of Yale and Charles J. Epstein of the University of 
California.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">At a news conference today, the Director of the F.B.I., Louis J. Freeh, and 
Inspector George Clow said the notation was found on an item that the 
Government received in June. The bureau has analyzed three items mailed in 
June: the two parcels and a letter sent about the same time from the bomber to 
The New York Times. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Federal investigators feel that Nathan R. may have received a telephone call 
from the bomber last June,&quot; Mr. Freeh said. 
&quot;We are asking members of the public, and Nathan R. himself, to call our 
toll-free number with any 
information they believe might be linked to the bomber.&quot; The number the Director gave is 1-800-701-BOMB.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The letter to The Times, like the two June parcels, was postmarked in June from 
Sacramento. It warned of 
&quot;a newsworthy event&quot; and identified its author as 
&quot;a group calling ourselves FC,&quot; although investigators say the bomber is one person. The letter also promised 
to 
&quot;give more information about our goals at some future time.&quot; Since then, the bomber has been idle. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">For years, investigators from three Federal agencies have searched with no 
success for the suspect they have called the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> so named because he initially struck universities and airline companies. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bomber has been seen only once, in a parking lot moments before a bomb 
exploded in 1987. He has left a string of baffling clues. Often, he has left 
the letters FC on some of the 
pieces of the bombs, and he meticulously crafts the deadly packages by 
constructing even the most elementary components, making it extremely difficult 
to trace where the parts were bought. He has also gone for years without 
sending packages and then suddenly re-emerged by sending several within a few 
months.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">His motive and method of selecting victims remain a mystery. Behavioral experts 
at the F.B.I. have theorized that because there are no links between the 
victims and because many of them have been on the cutting edge of computer 
sciences, psychology and genetics, the bomber may select his targets more for 
symbolic significance than because of any personal animus. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Based on the letter to The Times and the June bombings, investigators believe 
the bomber may periodically pick his victims from the columns of The Times or 
the 600 newspapers that use its news service. At least three of his targets 
have been featured in Times articles in ways that 
characterize them as leading figures in their fields.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">After the lethal packages were received in June, Federal investigators opened 
up a task force in San Francisco and Sacramento and assigned 45 agents and 
support staff members to try to solve the case. But after setting up what one 
official has called a whole new bureaucracy, the Government has developed few 
new leads.
