</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">David Gelernter is explaining why he seems to disagree with everybody.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I am always uncomfortable with an intellectual consensus,&quot; says the Yale computer scientist. Slightly heavyset, with a mop of curly dark 
hair and a dark beard, the bespectacled Gelernter resembles a bear with a 
cultivated appreciation for discussing the Talmud. 
&quot;When everybody stands around shaking their heads and saying 'obviously,' I have 
to wonder if they're not being lazy.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">This distrust of conventional thinking has led the 39-year-old academic into 
strange territory over the years. Take his new book, 
&quot;The Muse in the Machine: Computerizing the Poetry of Human Thought.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Gelernter actually calls for science to develop computers with emotions -- a 
computer capable of telling its users to 
&quot;buzz off.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He foresees one such computer, programmed to advise lawyers, that might balk:
</p><p class="body" align="Left">User: So? What's the answer?
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Computer: Sorry. I was just thinking about the opening paragraphs of 
&quot;Emma&quot; ...
</p><p class="body" align="Left">User: Why are we talking about Jane Austen? Stick to the point.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Computer: It's just something about the slightly vulnerable self-assurance of 
the plaintiff that got me off on this, I suppose.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Please. Most of us find our PCs obstinate. Must they become petulant?
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But Gelernter argues that his immodest proposal is the quickest road to 
creating computers with the creative spark that is the hallmark of the human 
mind. He says everything you think about how you think is wrong.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Insubordinate electronics are more or less the last thing we need at the moment,&quot; Gelernter admits. Yet, 
&quot;when we have added 
emotion, then and only then will our computers be capable of surprising us with 
an occasional genuine insight.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Insight is one of those things David Gelernter has a lot of. Also chutzpah.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He is also one of the few people in the world who can begin anecdotes with 
&quot;After I got blown up ...&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Surviving the Blow
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Early in the morning on June 24, 1993, Gelernter was going through the mail 
when he opened a book-size package. It turned out to be a shrapnel-packed 
letter bomb, and David Gelernter joined the unlucky ranks of the 13 scientists 
and executives targeted by 
<strong>UNABOM,</strong> the FBI's code name for a serial bomber who has killed one person and injured 
23 in all since beginning his attacks in 1978. No warning. No rationale. Boom.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Gelernter, bloody but lucid, made his 
way from his office in Arthur K. Watson Hall to the Yale infirmary. He wouldn't 
emerge from the hospital for six weeks and is still recovering.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He has taken his tragedy with spirit and wit. Last August, Gelernter came home 
from the hospital, sat down at his computer and pecked out a brief note to 
colleagues on the Yale computer science faculty describing his injuries and 
expressing hopes that he would return to teaching by the spring. (He did.)
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The note, which he posted electronically and which was subsequently distributed 
worldwide in a kind of digital samizdat, showed a nearly jaunty attitude toward 
his ordeal. Calling himself 
&quot;the department's very own official terrorist bomb victim,&quot; Gelernter wrote: 
&quot;All in all, I am the luckiest man alive (emphasis on alive). Surviving the 
explosion was evidently a pretty neat trick on my part, and I could have been 
hurt much worse.&quot; Expressing thanks to his family, friends and colleagues, he joked that he was 
&quot;privileged&quot; to be an academic in computer science, a field in which 
&quot;one decent typing hand and an intact head is all you really need.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He still depends on his wife, Jane, for many two-handed tasks; she nursed him 
to health during the months that he was immobilized with both hands bandaged 
and unusable.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Walking with a visitor in the living room of his book-filled home outside of 
New Haven, the damage is evident today: Dark scars snake across his arms and 
can be glimpsed under his loose shirt. He is in the midst of a series of 
operations that might eventually bring sight back to his lacerated right eye. 
He has recovered the use of his left hand, but surgery continues on his right, 
now reduced to three tortured fingers.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The doctors had initially 
suggested amputating the hand but agreed to try to save as much of it as they 
could, performing what Gelernter calls 
&quot;a heroic piece of surgery.&quot; He later discovered that he could, with the help of a strap, grasp a pencil or 
brush between his index and middle fingers, making the additional pain of 
surgery worthwhile. 
&quot;I was so thrilled to discover that I could draw again; I thought I never would.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Now he does a good deal of his work at home. He can work at his Macintosh, 
which is linked to the university computers. He has moved it from a basement 
study into the breakfast nook, close by the computer his two sons use for games 
and fun. 
&quot;I discovered I love being in the kitchen with the boys romping around.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He draws a connoisseur's pleasure from what most people take for granted: 
surviving. In the acknowledgments to his new book, he gives 
thanks for the compassion and aid during the awful summer of '93, when he found 
that 
&quot;help was so generously forthcoming that I almost believe we will remember the 
summer more, in the end, for the kindness of family, friends, the community and 
total strangers than for the crime that occasioned it. If it in fact works out 
that way, isn't the only possible conclusion that good beats evil in the end?&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Fun With Linda and ADA
</p><p class="body" align="Left">David Gelernter has always been the man on the outside. In the 1970s, he helped 
to create software that confounded expectations of what individual computers 
could do. He developed software linking workstations so that, by taking 
advantage of each machine's idle moments for collaborative computation, they 
operated together as efficiently as mainframes or even supercomputers.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Gelernter named his creation Linda, and therein lies an awful pun. The 
government had sponsored the development of a computer 
language named ADA, a tip of the hat to Ada, countess of Lovelace, the daughter 
of the poet Byron and a 19th-century pioneer in the theory of computing. 
Gelernter puckishly named his creation Linda, after a very different Lovelace. 
The project has been spun off into a New Haven company, SCA, that engages 
Gelernter as a consultant.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Gelernter gives free rein to this nonconformist streak in his book. A 
dilettante's delight, it takes the reader on a sweeping tour of cognitive 
science, computer science, English Romantic poetry and even biblical 
interpretation -- and Gelernter thumbs his nose at established experts every 
step of the way. He says he yearned to write it, but didn't relish the ire it 
was likely to raise. 
&quot;It took me a decade to write and publish this book because I knew people would 
hate it, and 
I didn't want to pick fights with people.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I think wistfully -- if not quite longingly -- about people who fit in better,&quot; Gelernter says.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The underlying theme of 
&quot;Muse in the Machine&quot; is Gelernter's attempt to come up with a new theory of consciousness -- one 
that gives a greater role to the emotions than is common in the fields of 
cognitive science and artificial intelligence.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">One of the kinds of mental glue that holds memories together, Gelernter 
theorizes, is emotion, which is inextricably tied to the body. Gelernter writes 
that 
&quot;an emotion is a mental state with physical correlates; it is the felt state of 
mind, where 'felt' means that signals reach the brain that are interpreted as 
bodily sensations, however fleeting and subtle.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Gelernter describes a spectrum of thinking that runs from 
&quot;high focus&quot; -- sharp, analytical thinking -- to a 
&quot;low focus&quot; mode in which we have less control 
over our train of thought and ideas come up unbidden. We travel down the 
spectrum as we tire; our thought trains become unfocused. Similarly, Gelernter 
writes, we gain tighter focus for our thoughts as we move from infancy to 
maturity. Gelernter even claims that the human race has moved up the spectrum 
over the centuries, developing the ability for rational thought rather late in 
the game.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Although he calls high-focus thought one of mankind's greatest achievements, 
Gelernter suggests that we have come to undervalue the mode of thinking at the 
other end of the spectrum. The thread linking low-focus thoughts is emotion, 
Gelernter says. He talks of a palette of feelings so varied and nuanced that 
incidents sharing a distinct emotional flavor might be linked in our minds, 
though they may be logically unrelated.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">To illustrate the point, he looks not only to cognitive theorists, 
but also to the English Romantic poets, whose works, he says, are 
&quot;about different kinds of thought&quot; -- poems such as Shelley's 
&quot;Mont Blanc&quot;:
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The everlasting universe of things
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Flows through the mind, rolls its rapid waves,
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Now dark, now glittering ...  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Coming Under Fire
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The tone of the book is sweeping, audacious, sometimes even more than a little 
arrogant. In one footnote he jokes, 
&quot;In case you were wondering, all of my claims are right. (It's good to have that 
settled.)&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But why an emotional computer? It's a way to test the hypothesis. Although the 
machine itself might be useless, Gelernter admits, the act of putting it 
together could lead to interesting discoveries.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Although he expected brickbats, his book has in fact been generally well 
received. Daniel Dennett, one of the experts in cognition and computer science 
whom Gelernter expected to dislike the book, told a 
reporter that he found it provocative, not upsetting.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But Steven Pinker, director of the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, took on Gelernter's 
&quot;bullying tone&quot; in a New York Times book review and called the central thesis 
&quot;vulnerable&quot;: 
&quot;Could our ancestors really have survived in unforgiving deserts and tundras if 
they had lived in a free-associating hallucinatory fog instead of focusing on 
their very real practical problems?&quot; In e-mail, Gelernter calls the criticism 
&quot;the we-are-not-amused voice of the cognitive science establishment.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A Life of the Mind
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The book's pinball-like bounce between the humanities and the sciences reflects 
Gelernter's education and career. He grew up in New York's Westchester County 
with a love of drawing and books, but also found himself drawn to his father's 
career in the sciences. (Herbert Gelernter, 
a pioneering expert in the field of artificial intelligence, now teaches at the 
State University of New York, Stony Brook.)
</p><p class="body" align="Left">David Gelernter entered Yale University in 1972 to study biophysics. He spent a 
year in grad school at Yale studying classical Hebrew literature, then moved to 
New York, where he enrolled in Yeshiva University for further biblical study. 
But he also took courses in drawing at the Art Students League, and recalls the 
blur of Yeshiva by day and sketching by night as one of 
&quot;the most intellectually rigorous and emotionally satisfying&quot; times of his life.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He couldn't help but notice, however, that his studies didn't seem to be 
building toward a career. 
&quot;I was very precocious in some ways and amazingly dumb in other ways,&quot; Gelernter says. 
&quot;I started thinking it was 
time to find a way to make a living and support a family.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He snagged a doctorate in computer science at Stony Brook by 1982 and headed 
back to Yale to teach and continue his research.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">And so it went, work and learning and genial arguments with colleagues, until 
the bomb.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Gelernter has made the most of his forced sabbatical. His quest to understand 
how the mind works has led him to explore the ancient mind, and to question why 
some passages in the Bible, for instance, seem marvelously incomprehensible if 
not halucinogenic today. (For example, in Exodus, after the Lord orders Moses 
to return to Egypt, Moses stopped on the way and 
&quot;the Lord met him and tried to kill him. But Tsipporah [Moses' wife] took a 
flint, cut off her son's foreskin and touched it to his feet; she said, 'You 
are my bloody bridegroom!' And he 
withdrew from him.&quot; Go figure.)
</p><p class="body" align="Left">At the same time, Gelernter is at work on his next book, trying to understand a 
more recent shift in the cultural state of mind. The feeling of ripe optimism 
that suffused the 1939 World's Fair in New York is a stark contrast to today's 
dark view of technology and the future. Yet back then, Hitler was on the march, 
antibiotics were not used to treat disease -- even the president had not been 
spared from polio. 
&quot;Along virtually any axis we are immensely better off today,&quot; Gelernter says, gesturing absent-mindedly with his right hand, which he keeps 
concealed under a white surgical sock.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Ideally, Gelernter says, a book that makes sense of this conundrum could even 
nudge the Zeitgeist, if only a little. He admits that it would be 
&quot;unforgivable arrogance on the part of a writer to say 'I want to change the mood.' 
&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But it's clear that he does hope to restore a little of the shine that we have 
lost.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">His Own Man
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A visitor asks why Gelernter always seems to stake out a position on the other 
side of the crowd. The next day, a pensive bit of e-mail pops up on the 
visitor's computer screen:
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I've been thinking about your comment that perhaps I take contrary positions 
for the hell of it, out of (what used to be called) cussedness... .&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He brings up his idiosyncratic paintings, which are just as he describes them, 
&quot;good drawing with neo-fauve colors.&quot; They hang throughout his home, in the comfortable living room with its massive 
stone fireplace. They resemble no one else's work -- least of all those modern 
artists he admires, such as Willem de Kooning and Jasper Johns. Yet, he says, 
&quot;I've never exhibited 
my paintings and don't specially ever intend to. They are different not because 
I wanted to pick a fight but just because, for better or worse, I am.&quot;
