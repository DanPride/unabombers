Special to The New York Times 


</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>DATELINE:</strong> SACRAMENTO, Calif.  


</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Shrapnel from a homemade bomb tore through Hugh Campbell Scrutton's heart in a 
windswept parking lot here in 1985, and the computer store owner cried for 
God's help as he died beside a Dumpster.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Earlier that year, a similar explosion at the University of California at 
Berkeley blew the fingers off Capt. John E. Hauser's right hand, ending the 
flying career of the ambitious young Air Force pilot and engineering student 
and shattering his dream of becoming an astronaut.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Three years before that, Diogenes J. Angelakos, an engineering professor at 
Berkeley, lost something equally valuable to him when an explosive contraption 
went off in the same university building. After surgery to repair the tendons 
of his right hand, Mr. Angelakos could no longer cook, clean or change the bed 
linens for his ailing wife, who died of cancer a month later. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">These three men were victims of a bomber who has practiced his deadly handiwork 
from coast to coast but nowhere more tragically than here in the Bay Area. 
Interviews with victims, relatives, witnesses and law-enforcement officials 
offer a detailed look at the bomber's meticulous craft, the blood and terror he 
has left behind and the frustrating cul-de-sacs that investigators have 
followed.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Four of the 14 bombs he built went off in this area, another was 
mailed from here and the only communication linked to all 14 of his bombings 
was postmarked here.

Meticulous Work
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Mr. Scrutton, Mr. Hauser and Professor Angelakos were all accidental targets 
of the bomber, people who happened upon a package that bore no address. Yet 
each of the 23 victims and their families were indelibly changed. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;This guy has affected so many lives,&quot; said Mr. Angelakos, who is now 74 and was recently summoned from retirement to 
serve as acting director of the Electronics Research Laboratory at Berkeley. 
&quot;How can one guy do that?&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Also scarred, if only emotionally, by the man called 
<strong>Unabom</strong> are the law-enforcement officials here who have wrestled with the mystifying 
cases: Detective Bob Bell and retired Lieut. Ray Biondi from the homicide unit 
of the Sacramento Sheriff's Office and Lieut. William P. Foley, the commander 
of the bomb squad on the Berkeley campus. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">These men continue to 
pore over loose-leaf binders of evidence. They continue to toss and turn at 
night, considering and rejecting theories. And with the latest bombings, which 
produced substantial new evidence and heightened Federal interest, they are 
hopeful that a solution may be in sight. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;We're jazzed, we're juiced, we're ready,&quot; Detective Bell said.

Bomb Left in Break Room
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The bomb that injured Mr. Angelakos exploded at 7:47 A.M. on July 2, 1982, in 
the coffee break room on the fourth floor of Cory Hall, home of Berkeley's 
engineering and computer science departments. 
<a name="Handle"></a>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The device was cylindrical, studded with gauges and dials, and had wires 
running up its sides attached to a handle. There was construction going on in 
the building at the time and Mr. Angelakos said that his 
&quot;first thought was that a contractor had left it.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"><a href="../GovernmentBehaviors.htm#Timms">The professor reached 
for the handle, which put tension on the wires and caused a pipe bomb inside to 
detonate. Below the pipe bomb, at the base of the cylinder, was gasoline, which 
failed to vaporize and thus did not ignite into a fireball. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The custodian at Cory Hall, Ricky Timms, told the police that he had seen an 
unfamiliar man in the corridor nearby and speculated that he might have placed 
the bomb. </a>

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Court files include a police sketch prepared with the custodian's help. But for 
sunglasses and a hooded sweatshirt, the man, fair-skinned and with a narrow 
mustache, looks very much like the person seen placing a similar bomb in the 
parking lot behind a Salt Lake City computer store in 1987.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Amid the debris of the bomb that injured Mr. Angelakos was a scrap of paper 
with these words: 
&quot;Wu -- It works! I 
told you it would. R.V.&quot; Lieutenant Foley said that 1,000 fruitless hours were spent trying to 
interpret that message. Experts in codes were consulted, as were members of the 
university's English department who might see a veiled literary reference. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The device that maimed Mr. Hauser was superficially different from the one that 
injured Mr. Angelakos. It resembled a loose-leaf binder, attached by a rubber 
band to a plastic file-card box, the sort of thing a graduate student might 
tote from classroom, to laboratory, to library.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">It had been on a table in room 264 at Cory Hall, a computer room, for several 
days before Mr. Hauser grew curious enough to open the binder at 1:41 P.M. on 
May 15, 1985. That movement activated a switch. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">According to 
police reports, 
&quot;all the fingers and thumb on the right hand were violently amputated.&quot; Mr. Hauser's bicep muscle was also torn to shreds. Mr. Angelakos was one of 
the first on the scene to help Mr. Hauser, who was an Air Force captain at the 
time, studying for a master's degree in engineering. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">After the bombing, Mr. Hauser endured a lengthy rehabilitation and taught 
himself to write with his left hand. A year behind schedule he completed his 
degree. He then won a fellowship for work at Berkeley and was medically 
discharged from the Air Force. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mr. Hauser, now 34, taught engineering at the University of Southern California 
until last year and is now a professor at the University of Colorado at 
Boulder. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Despite his crippling injuries, Mr. Hauser is a buoyant fellow. 
&quot;When you're faced with 
something you have to overcome, what are your options?&quot; he said in a telephone interview. 
&quot;People pat you on the back and say, 'Oh poor you,' for a while, but you 
eventually have to pick up, set a course and find something interesting to do.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">That was not an option for Mr. Scrutton. Mr. Scrutton, 38, was on his way to an 
appointment shortly after noon on Dec. 11, 1985, when he stepped out the rear 
door of his computer rental company in a mall here and nearly tripped over a 
package. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Inside was a bomb. It exploded as Mr. Scrutton bent over it and he caught the 
blast in his chest. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Oh my God, help me,&quot; Mr. Scrutton cried out, witnesses said, as employees from his store, RenTech 
Computer Rental, and other adjacent businesses rushed to his aid. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">First on the 
scene was an employee from a nearby software store and a customer, who had 
served in Vietnam as a medic. They administered CPR. It was too late. A 
half-hour after the blast, Mr. Scrutton was dead. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The employees at the software company described what they knew of the bombing 
on the condition that they not be identified because they fear the bomber's 
return. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Theirs is a concern common in Sacramento these days. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A letter to The New York Times, claiming credit for the series of bombings and 
authenticated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, bore a Sacramento 
postmark. And the city has been further tied to the two recent explosions, 
which injured a geneticist from the University of California at San Francisco 
and a computer scientist at Yale University. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Both of those bombs, addressed to the victims, bore Sacramento postmarks and 
fictitious return addresses of professors at California State 
University at Sacramento. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Lieutenant Biondi and Detective Bell wonder if the bomb that killed Mr. 
Scrutton was intended for someone at California State University, less than a 
mile from RenTech. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The investigators have traveled to Texas and Colorado to interview suspects. 
Both proved false leads. They have checked lists of Mr. Scrutton's customers, 
transfer students at the university, absentee ballots and airline flight 
reservations, to no avail. Physical evidence in their case was scarce because 
20-mile-per-hour winds had scattered it. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I can't stress the amount of work that's gone on,&quot; Detective Bell said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He has gathered everything he and Lieutenant Biondi know in 17 black loose-leaf 
binders, which sit on the top bookshelf in the homicide bureau here. After the 
most recent bombings, Detective Bell pulled the binders down in anticipation of 
a break in the case. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Does that mean he thinks the bomber is here in Sacramento? 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I would love it,&quot; Detective Bell said.
