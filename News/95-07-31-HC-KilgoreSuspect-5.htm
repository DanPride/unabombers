</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>DATELINE:</strong> SACRAMENTO, Calif.  



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">SACRAMENTO, Calif. - Each day the tips flow in, a hundred
of them, sometimes more.  They come from Sacramento, San
Francisco and places far beyond - from people who believe they
know the crafty serial bomber who has killed three people and
wounded 23 more.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Despite the extraordinary outpouring, authorities said last
week that there is no prime suspect in the 17-year-old Unabom
case.  But with the promise of a $ 1.1 million reward for the
killer's capture, there have been possibilities galore.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">For a time, federal agents zeroed in on a suspicious sailor,
only to learn he was at sea during one of the bombings.  On
another occasion, a handyman in Salt Lake City became a
tantalizing target, but he, too, had an alibi.  Authorities
also scrutinized a career criminal in Northern California,
because his Social Security number matches a code the bomber
uses to 
<strong>identify</strong> himself in letters.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">One potential suspect on the FBI's list is James William
Kilgore, 48, a fugitive from justice who went underground on a
bomb-related charge in 1976 and has not been seen since.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Kilgore is best known for his connections to the Symbionese
Liberation Army - the terrorist group that kidnapped newspaper
heiress Patricia Hearst more than two decades ago.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Some of those 
familiar with the Kilgore case see parallels
with the 
<strong>Unabomber.</strong>  The height and general appearance are
about right.  So is the timing: the bomber started mailing his
deadly packages in 1978, not long after Kilgore disappeared,
vowing to attack the U.S. government.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But the FBI has not pressed hard to find him, much to the
frustration of some critics of the Unabom probe: 
&quot;&quot;He is the
only fugitive wanted for bombing and hiding for 18 years - and
they can't find him? ''said one law enforcement source.  
&quot;&quot;At
least if they find him, they can find out whether he is the
guy. ''
 Officially, Kilgore remains 
&quot;&quot;a potential suspect, as much as
anybody else who hasn't been fully cleared, since he is still
a fugitive,'' said the FBI's Sacramento spokesman, Tom
Griffin.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The theory that Kilgore might be the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> was 
&quot;&quot;looked at
with a fine-toothed comb,'' said one federal 
source.  
&quot;&quot;Although
he hasn't been totally eliminated, it doesn't strike any of
(the investigators) as a juicy thing. ''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Those who knew Kilgore before he turned fugitive say he is an
unlikely serial killer.  He is a nice guy among hard-edged
radicals, they say, an idealist to the core.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Unlike many other potential suspects, Kilgore presents special
problems for investigators.  He has been underground so long
that even one-time friends cannot describe his current
appearance or political beliefs.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Like the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> his whereabouts are a mystery, which means
that agents cannot rule out his participation in the 16
attacks.  And like the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> his occupation, lifestyle and
habits are all unknown.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Kilgore first surfaced in connection with the case in April,
when KCBS-TV in Los Angeles, citing unnamed federal sources,
called him a 
&quot;&quot;prime 
suspect'' in the Unabom attacks.  FBI
officials have repudiated the report, but concede that Kilgore
is one of many people they would like to interview.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;&quot;I think he's interesting, and you certainly can't eliminate
him,'' said Lt.  Joe Enloe, a Sacramento homicide detective
involved in the investigation.  
&quot;&quot;The 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> has been
virtually invisible ... all these years, and you can say the
same about Kilgore. ''
 Said Herbert Clough, the former agent-in-charge of the Los
Angeles FBI office, 
&quot;&quot;He meets a lot of the qualifications, in
my view.  He's real interesting, because of a number of 
 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">similarities. ''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Among the reasons that Kilgore has attracted the attention of
some law enforcement officials:
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Photographs of Kilgore taken before he disappeared resemble a
composite sketch of the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> drawn after a lone 
<strong>witness</strong>
spotted him leaving a bomb in a Salt Lake City parking 
lot in
1987.  Like the bomber, Kilgore is a white male with reddish
hair now in his 40s.  His build - 5 feet, 10 inches, 170 pounds
- matches the description of the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> as a man 5 feet, 10
inches, 160 pounds.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He is, in the words of one law enforcement source, 
&quot;&quot;a man of
many disguises,'' who easily obtained driver's licenses and
other identification in other names.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Born in Portland, Ore., he is the son of a former Northern
California lumber broker, which may be significant because of
the wood theme running through the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> attacks.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Some of his explosive devices have arrived in wooden boxes,
while others have handcrafted wood parts.  One of his targets
was Percy Wood of Lake Forest, Ill., another lived on Aspen
Drive.  And his latest victim, Sacramento lobbyist Gilbert
Murray, worked for the California Forestry Association until
he was killed by a mail bomb in April.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Raised in Marin County, just north of San Francisco, Kilgore
knew the Bay Area intimately and also spent time in
Sacramento, 70 miles to the east.  Several of the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong>
packages and letters have been mailed from Sacramento.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">There are similarities between bombs planted by the Symbionese
Liberation Army in the 1970s and devices mailed by the
<strong>Unabomber.</strong>
