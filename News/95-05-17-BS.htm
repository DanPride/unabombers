</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">At 9 a.m. yesterday, Baltimore County Detective James H. Geibel was picking up 
a bag of illegal fireworks at a Woodlawn home. By noon, he was hauling several 
large boxes of black gunpowder and shotgun shells out of the Towson Precinct. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In between, Detective Geibel was sweating profusely in an 85-pound bomb suit 
while delicately analyzing a suspicious briefcase in a sixth-floor staircase of 
a Catonsville abortion clinic. An X-ray of the briefcase showed a fishy maze of 
integrated circuits.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">After a huge police response -- including road blocks, 39 police cars and four 
police dogs -- the briefcase was deemed safe. A careful check, lasting almost 
three hours, showed that the circuits were nothing more than a calculator. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;There's an old saying that goes, 'There are old bomb technicians and there are 
bold bomb technicians, but there are no old, bold bomb technicians,' 
&quot; said Detective Geibel, a 23-year police veteran who joined the county's police 
bomb squad in 1988. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;You can never be too careful.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A couple of days into the county's explosives turn-in program, things are 
hopping for Detective Geibel and Detective Jim E. Noel, his partner in the 
two-man squad. Besides retrieving dangerous devices, they also must respond to 
calls on incidents such as the one yesterday at Hillcrest 
Abortion Clinic. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The turn-in program -- which offers county residents a safe, no-questions-asked 
disposal of explosives -- began in 1974. Since then, officers have retrieved 
thousands of hazardous devices and material, including homemade explosives, 
cannonballs, gunpowder and signal flares. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Callers who report explosives through the 911 emergency number don't have to 
give their names and will not face criminal charges. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Today, amid such high-profile cases as the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> and the recent bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City, major cities 
across the nation require the full-time service of specially trained and 
equipped bomb squads. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Places such as Baltimore County, which started its unit in 1973, also are 
finding bomb units indispensable. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms said 423 explosives incidents have been reported in Maryland since 
1989. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Baltimore 
County bomb technicians responded to more than 300 calls last year, including 
false alarms and routine incidents. Figures weren't available on the number of 
calls involving actual explosives. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Baltimore City and Prince George's and Montgomery counties are the only 
other Maryland localities with full-time bomb squads. Emergencies in the rest of 
the state are handled by the State Fire Marshal's bomb squad.</body></html>
