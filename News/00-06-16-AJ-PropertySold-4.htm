Texas A&amp;M University has reportedly decided to suspend its traditional pre- game 
bonfire following an accident last year that killed 12 students. Relatives of 
the victims said in published reports today that the bonfire, a 90-year 
tradition, will be suspended until at least 2002 and resume only under 
engineers' supervision.  The collapse of the 2 million-pound log stack last 
Nov. 18 also injured 27 students. A school commission blamed flawed 
construction techniques and inadequate supervision of students assembling the 
four-tiered stack. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Michael Self, father of victim Jerry Don Self, said a letter from A&amp;M vice president Malon Southerland said future bonfires will rely on groups of 
professional, adult supervisors. 
According to a school memo sent to victims' relatives, the bonfire stack will 
also be smaller and constructed in a single- tier, teepee-style structure. Many 
victims' relatives have called for the bonfire tradition to continue, and a 
student group collected 7,204 signatures.

Virus deadly to humans found in N.Y. fowl 

A chicken has tested positive in New York for the West Nile virus in the same 
area as last year's deadly outbreak, city officials said. The chicken --- among 
dozens of ''sentinel'' birds being regularly tested --- will be retested at the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and a Department of 
Agriculture lab in Iowa, Dr. Neal Cohen, the city's health commissioner, said 
Thursday. Results are expected by Saturday. If the chicken tests positive 
again, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said the city would begin pesticide spraying next 
week. Last summer, West Nile virus killed six people and infected 62 others in

<strong>Unabomber</strong> to sell Montana property 

Ted Kaczynski is selling the rural Montana property where he lived alone in a 
one-room cabin for more than two decades and plotted a mail-bombing spree. Joy 
Richards, 47, has corresponded with the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> since his arrest, and has agreed to pay $ 7,500 for his share of the 1.4-acre 
plot of land four miles from her Lincoln, Mont., home. Kaczynski, 58, is 
serving life without parole in a federal prison for the bombings that killed 
three people and injured 23 others. 
Kaczynski's brother David owns part of the property and said Thursday he had no 
plans to sell.

Deadly helicopter crash blamed on crew 

A Marine Corps helicopter crash off San Diego that killed seven men was caused

investigation into the Dec. 9 accident.
