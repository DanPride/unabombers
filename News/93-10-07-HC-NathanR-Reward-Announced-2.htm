</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong> 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">WASHINGTON -- Admitting they have no &quot;&quot;viable''
suspects in <a id="Nathan"></a>
mail bombings that have killed one person and injured 23 since 
1978, federal authorities Wednesday announced a $ 1 million reward 
for information leading to the capture of the so-called 
&quot;&quot;<strong>Unabomber.</strong>&quot;&quot; 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
<a href="http://www.unabombers.com/#Nathan">Federal investigators revealed the latest clue -- a note 
scrawled on paper that says, &quot;&quot;Call Nathan R -- Wed 7 PM'' -- that
they believe the bomber may have written as a reminder to make a 
telephone call. </a>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
FBI Director <a href="http://www.unabombers.com/z19.htm">Louis Freeh</a> said &quot;&quot;Nathan R'' may have received 
a telephone call from the bomber in June, when two university 
professors were maimed by mail bombs within two days of each other. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Nathan R's association &quot;&quot;may be completely innocent,'' Freeh 
added. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
The unusual nature of the appeal for help and the size of the 
reward underscored the frustration felt by investigators, who 
conceded they were baffled by the person or persons responsible for 
sending 14 bombs in 15 years to professors, airlines and computer 
experts. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
&quot;&quot;We're at a dead end,'' said a law enforcement official who 
asked not to be identified. &quot;&quot;For $ 1 million, there are going to be 
a lot of nuts coming out of the woodwork. '' 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
The FBI; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; and the 
U.S. Postal Inspection Service each contributed $ 150,000 to the 
reward fund, with the rest contributed by anonymous organizations
and individuals. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
People wishing to give information are instructed to call a 
toll-free number: (800) 701-2662. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
&quot;&quot;Progress is essential in this case because there is great 
concern that the bomber will strike again,'' said Ronald Noble, the 
assistant Treasury secretary for enforcement. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
FBI Inspector George Clow, head of a 45-person &quot;&quot;Unabomb'' 
task force, termed the bombings &quot;&quot;cowardly acts'' that have lasting 
psychological effects on the victims. &quot;&quot;I was touched by the 
genuine horror, the genuine terror that these people feel to this 
day,'' he said. &quot;&quot;Their whole lives have been affected, and they 
don't understand why. '' 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
After a six-year hiatus, the most recent bombs were mailed 
June 18 in Sacramento, Calif., to professors at the University of 
California-San Francisco and Yale University. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
On June 22, Dr. Charles J.Epstein, a geneticist at the San 
Francisco school, lost several fingers when a parcel bomb exploded 
at his home in Tiburon. Two days later, Yale computer scientist 
David Gelernter suffered serious wounds to his abdomen, chest, face 
and hands when he opened a package bomb in his office. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Both parcels had return addresses of different professors at 
California <a id="NathanMailDate"> State</a> University-<a id="Sacramento">Sacramento</a>.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
<a href="http://www.unabombers.com/#Nathan">On the day Gelernter received his
package, a letter 
postmarked June 21 from Sacramento arrived at the New York Times. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
The letter, written by a person who claimed that a group was 
responsible for the earlier bombings, bore the initials &quot;&quot;FC,'' 
which were found on other bomb fragments. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Clow said the letter was being treated as genuine because it 
was dated before the bombings and predicted a &quot;&quot;newsworthy event. '' 
</a></p><p class="body" align="Left">
Based on what are literally scraps of evidence, investigators 
describe the bomber as a white man in his late 40s or early 50s 
with training or education in explosives, electronics and 
woodworking. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Behavioral scientists see the bomber as &quot;&quot;rigid and 
inflexible, someone who may be perceived as a very nice person with 
a sense of humor that appears at times to be macabre or 
tasteless,'' said John W. Magaw, acting director of the ATF.
