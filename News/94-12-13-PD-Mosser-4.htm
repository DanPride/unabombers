</p><p class="body" align="Left">Thomas J. Mosser had reached a high point in his career, newly promoted to a 
top job at Young 
&amp; Rubicam Inc., the giant ad agency. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Already he had been involved in a number of attention-getting campaigns: 
handling the media during the Tylenol poisoning scare, helping promote the 
disastrous new Coke formula and the reintroduction of classic Coke, and 
organizing the 1984 cross-country Olympic torch run. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">But outside Madison Avenue, he was probably unknown to anyone but a very close 
reader of the business pages. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">And somewhere in his list of clients may lie a clue to why the 50-year-old New 
Jersey man was sent a mail bomb that killed him in the kitchen of his mansion 
Saturday in North Caldwell, a New York suburb, as he was going through the mail 
before going out to 
buy a Christmas tree. (THE FOLLOWING WAS INSERTED IN THE 3* EDITION) 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;He was really an all-American kind of person, and the last person you would 
think this would happen to,&quot; said longtime friend Robert Dilenschneider. (END OF 3* INSERTION) 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">On Monday, a United Parcel Service worker who tried to deliver a package to 
Mosser's mansion was intercepted by police. The package turned out to be 
harmless. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A longtime friend, Robert Dilenschneider, said Mosser 
&quot;was really an all-American kind of person, and the last person you would think 
this would happen to.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI believes Mosser is the latest victim of the man the bureau calls the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> who since 1978 has killed two people and injured 23. On Monday, investigators 
could not say why Mosser had been targeted by the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> whose previous targets had connections to universities, airlines or computers. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Investigators were searching for any link between Mosser and the rest of the 
<strong>Unabom</strong> victims. Richard McGowan, a Young 
&amp; 
Rubicam spokesman, said there was no indication that the bombing was related to 
Mosser's work, but the FBI said it was reviewing Mosser's client list. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Industry watchers at trade magazines said some of Mosser's former clients at Y&amp;R's public relations subsidiary, Burson-Marsteller Worldwide, were in the 
airline industry. And computer giants Xerox Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp. 
had recently hired Young 
&amp; Rubicam. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI said Monday that the package the bomb came in had borne a return 
address and Dec. 3 postmark from San Francisco. A team of agents in New Jersey 
and the 
<strong>Unabom</strong> task force, based in San Francisco, are investigating. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Law enforcement officials suspect that the bomber does not know his victims but 
rather is seeking to make some kind of symbolic statement. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Over the years, Mosser helped 
Johnson 
&amp; Johnson handle media inquiries during the Tylenol poisoning cases in 1982. 
Seven people in the Chicago area died after taking Tylenol capsules poisoned 
with cyanide. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mosser also handled Coca-Cola's introduction of its new Coke in the mid-1980s - 
one of the biggest blunders in marketing history - and then the unveiling of 
Coca-Cola Classic. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">He also organized the 1984 cross-country Olympic Torch Run, was hired to help 
South Korea act as host of the Olympics and was a member of the New York City 
Bicentennial Committee. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Dilenschneider, chief executive at the New York-based public relations agency, 
the Dilenschneider Group, described Mosser as 
&quot;a very fair, honest, ethical competitor.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mosser was promoted Dec. 1 to general manager of Young 
&amp; Rubicam Inc., also retaining his title as executive vice president. He was 
former vice chairman and 
chief operating officer of Burson-Marsteller, which he joined in 1969. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">His promotion brought him notice in the trade press, and he had been named in a 
1986 Fortune magazine article as among 
&quot;people to watch&quot; in business. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mosser served on the Board of Governors for the Children's Miracle Network from 
1990 to 1992. 
&quot;He helped open the doors of large corporations for us,&quot; said Roger Cook, a spokesman for the nonprofit group. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mosser; his wife, Susan; and their two children, 13 years and 15 months, moved 
into their $ 900,000 home on Aspen Drive about four years ago. Mayor Jim 
Matarazzo, owner of Matarazzo Farms and Garden Center, said the Mossers were 
customers. 
&quot;They were nice, good residents. The community - we're in shock.&quot; Ticking Package 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In Meriden, Conn., a ticking Christmas package frightened postal 
workers, who summoned the police bomb squad Monday. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The package later proved to contain a telephone answering machine and 
batteries. But it was making what one worker called 
&quot;funny ticking noises.&quot;
