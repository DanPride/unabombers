</p><p class="subheader" align="left"><strong>HEADLINE:</strong> Critic Sees Flaws in Microsoft's Strategy 



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> 
By JOHN MARKOFF 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">As Microsoft prepares to announce its Next Generation Windows Services 
initiative this week, an influential computer scientist is circulating a thesis 
that challenges William H. Gates's vision of the future.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">On Thursday, Microsoft plans to describe its most radically new computing 
strategy since December 1995, when Mr. Gates, the Microsoft chairman, announced 
the 
&quot;embrace and extend&quot; strategy to expand the company's dominance of desktop computing to include the 
Internet.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Microsoft will now push to shift the locus of computing off the desktop 
altogether -- and out into a 
&quot;cloud&quot; of large server computers located on the Internet. But the goal is the same as 
the one laid out five years ago: maintaining a central role for Microsoft's 
software. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">This time, though, an influential critic is arguing that Microsoft's new 
strategy may be a defensive plan that misjudges the computer industry's future 
direction -- that rather than moving to an increasingly Web-centric model, 
computing is instead becoming decentralized, with the key information 
distributed among millions of desktop computers. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;It sounds as if Microsoft is scared and defensive,&quot; the critic, David Gelernter, said in a telephone interview last week.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Microsoft has based its reputation on refusing to lead and always following, 
and once again they're behind the wave here,&quot; said 
Mr. Gelernter, a respected Yale University computer scientist. 
&quot;More and more people are coming to understand that the power of desktop 
machines is enormous and is largely wasted when you spend your time browsing on 
the Web.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mr. Gelernter's argument is spelled out in 
&quot;The Second Coming -- a Manifesto,&quot; an essay published last week in the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine 
Zeitung, and posted on the Edge, a technology forum on the Web (www.edge.org). 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mr. Gelernter's critique has some influential supporters, including Danny 
Hillis, a computer scientist who recently left Walt Disney's Imagineering 
research group to form a new company, Applied Minds; David Ditzel, a computer 
designer who is the founder of Transmeta Inc., a Silicon Valley microprocessor 
company; and Rodney Brooks, director of the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;David's criticisms of our current computing environments are eloquently stated, 
and I think widely shared,&quot; Mr. Brooks wrote in a recent comment posted on the Internet.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But Microsoft's head of research, Rick Rashid, countered that Mr. Gelernter was 
taking a long-term view of computing that might have little relevance for the 
current software market. 
&quot;It's fairly predictable that David would be saying this,&quot; said Mr. Rashid, a Microsoft senior vice president. 
&quot;This has been his mantra throughout his career.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Second Coming,&quot; a 10,000-word essay, contends that rather than remaining a world that 
Microsoft or any company might dominate, computing is actually shifting to a 
world in which data and computer processing will be increasingly spread across 
thousands, if not millions, of interconnected computers.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Information 
travels through a sea of anonymous, interchangeable computers like a breeze 
through tall grass,&quot; Mr. Gelernter wrote. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">But Mr. Rashid said Mr. Gelernter's criticism did not reflect the degree to 
which data was already being distributed across the Internet.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;That's already happening,&quot; Mr. Rashid said. 
&quot;There is already a sea of information.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Microsoft has pointed to Passport, a current e-commerce service offered by the 
company, as the best example of what the Next Generation Windows Services 
architecture will be like. Passport, a program that verifies the identities of 
computer users when they surf to a new site, is a clear example of the way data 
is now flowing through the Internet between computers that are only loosely 
coupled, Mr. Rashid said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Passport actually encompasses a huge amount of distributed computing,&quot; he said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">At the same 
time, he acknowledged that Mr. Gelernter's vision of a distributed computing 
future is likely to be an accurate one over the long haul. He noted that there 
had been a long tug-of-war between the ideas of centralized and decentralized 
computing. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mr. Gelernter, who was seriously injured in 1993 by a mail bomb from the 
so-called 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> is a well-known computer scientist. His credentials include his 1991 book 
&quot;Mirror Worlds,&quot; which forecast the arrival of the World Wide Web and described a future in 
which computing would make it possible to simulate virtually any aspect of the 
world.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">As a software designer during the 1980's, Mr. Gelernter developed a programming 
language known as Linda that was designed to spread computations across 
hundreds of thousands of computers, harnessing them into one distributed 
machine. Similar systems are now common in the world of 
supercomputing. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">But distributed computing has been slow to arrive in the mainstream computing 
world, and Mr. Gelernter places the blame for the lack of innovation to a great 
extent on the absence of a new computing vision from Microsoft.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He contends that Microsoft's Windows 98 and Windows 2000 software is derived 
from the Apple Macintosh and the Unix operating systems, which he derides as 
fragile, decades-old technologies that lock away much of the power of computing 
from nonexpert users.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;They have the bulliest pulpit in the world,&quot; Mr. Gelernter said of Microsoft, 
&quot;but what have they done with it?&quot;
