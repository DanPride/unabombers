<strong>Unabomber</strong> Theodore Kaczynski, serving a life sentence for three murders, has filed court 
papers seeking to have his guilty plea withdrawn and a new trial with a 
different judge.
A judge yesterday ordered the release of ballistics reports that relatives of 
the Columbine High massacre victims hope will bolster their claims that law 
officers mishandled the situation.  
The report will go to the victims' relatives and to the families of gunmen Eric 
Harris and Dylan Klebold.
A grand jury will investigate the deadly collapse of a nightclub pier along the 
Delaware River to determine whether criminal charges should be filed, 
Philadelphia officials said yesterday.
The widows of three of the six firefighters killed in a Worcester, Mass., 
warehouse fire in December have filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against the 
owners of the building.
Los Angeles archbishop Cardinal Roger Mahony yesterday called on California 
Gov. Gray Davis to suspend executions and conduct a review of the fairness of 
the state's death-penalty process.

People

A Decatur, Ill., judge yesterday backed the school board's decision to bar the 
Rev. Jesse Jackson and other Rainbow/PUSH Coalition members from the graduation

fighting. Jackson honored the ruling.
