</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> BY BOB ANEZ

</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The search of 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> suspect Theodore Kaczynski's cabin yielded several guns, explosive devices, 
the names and addresses of corporate executives, street maps of the San 
Francisco area and bus schedules, an FBI document confirmed today.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In a filing released in U.S. District Court, the FBI also confirmed published 
reports that three typewriters had been found in the cabin, as well as 
unspecified documents and notes.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But the lengthy list does not 
<strong>identify</strong> any of those documents as the original text of the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> manifesto, copies of which were sent to the New York Times and the Washington 
Post. A source told the Associated Press last week that a document was found 
that appeared to be the original of the manifesto.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The list does not use the word 
&quot;<strong>Unabomber,</strong>&quot; and it does not 
<strong>identify</strong> the corporate executives.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Kaczynski, 53, was arrested at the cabin near Lincoln, Mont., two weeks ago and 
is being held on a single count of possessing bomb components. He has not been 
charged with any of the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> attacks, which have killed three people and injured 23 in nine states over the 
past 18 years.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI's 34-page list, with 20 or so items on each page, was released today 
along with the search warrant for the cabin and the description of what was 
expected to be found. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The findings were sometimes in meticulous detail. One finding, for example, 
simply read: 
&quot;One 'Calumet Baking Powder' can containing soldering wire.&quot; The listings offered no interpretation or attempt to link the items either to 
the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> or to his crimes.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But the items are suggestive. Dozens of 
entries were for chemicals. A pipe bomb was found, and at least four guns.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The list also described a hooded jacket, a blue zippered sweatshirt and hood 
and two pairs of plastic glasses. A 
<strong>witness</strong> who saw the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> plant one bomb described him as wearing a hooded sweatshirt and aviator 
glasses, resulting in the widely circulated artist's sketch.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI list, a computer inventory dated last Thursday, was ordered released 
today by U.S. District Judge Charles Lovell, the judge who authorized the 
original search.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The references to San Francisco and to corporate executives were cryptic. The 
item was listed as: 
&quot;One 'Aldrich' box containing misc. papers, newspaper clippings, bus schedule, 
addresses of corporate officials and maps of San Francisco.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">However, the references may be significant because the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> who raged against modern 
technology, targeted executives, focusing particularly on those linked to 
resource industries. Three of the bombings occurred in the San Francisco Bay 
area.
