</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">State Assembly Speaker and likely San Francisco mayoral contender Willie Brown 
was diagnosed with the degenerative eye disease retinitis pigmentosa in the 
1980s and could by now be legally blind, according to a story this week in the 
Western Edition, a neighborhood newspaper in San Francisco's Western Addition.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Retinitis pigmentosa is a hereditary disease that afflicts approximately 
100,000 people in the United States.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''He probably has very little vision left,'' a University of California 
professor and practicing optometrist told the paper. ''By 60, if you can see at 
all, you're lucky. Sometimes there is a little bit of cloudy central vision 
preserved to the end.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Brown, who turned 61 in March, did not respond to the paper's questions. But 
his press aide, Darolyn Davis, told the Edition that Brown ''doesn't have to 
see anything to do his job. It has no impact whatever on his performance.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''It's bad, horrible,'' one confidant who has known Brown for years told us 
after the story appeared.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''It shows when he has to read something. He holds the paper right up to his 
face. If you stand off to the side and say 'hello' and he doesn't know your 
voice, he won't recognize you.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">So how does he manage?
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He has phenomenal retention. So good that after one glance he can quote from 
pages and pages of bills and reports almost verbatim.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">* STINK BOMB
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Parking and ticket honcho John Newlin gets more than his share of hate mail -- 
but even he wasn't ready for a package that 
arrived recently:
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Used toilet paper and a note addressed ''Dear Bureaucrap.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''I guess this is San Francisco's answer to the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong>'' Newlin said from his downtown office.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">What made the prank even more weird was the note of apology that arrived the 
next day.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">* TOP DOLLAR
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Secretary of State's annual report on who's spending the most to lobby in 
Sacramento is in. In all, lobbyists spent a record $ 250.2 million during the 
1993-94 legislative session.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Here are the winners:
</p><p class="body" align="Left">1) $ 1.8 million -- Western States Petroleum Association
</p><p class="body" align="Left">2) $ 1.8 million -- Pacific Telesis
</p><p class="body" align="Left">3) $ 1.4 million -- State Farm
</p><p class="body" align="Left">4) $ 1.4 million -- Chevron Corporation
</p><p class="body" align="Left">5) $ 1.3 million -- California Association of Hospitals and Health Systems.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">And what does the money go for?
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''We track about 800 to 1,000 bills at any given time. We have 
about 475 hospitals and another 200 personal and affiliated members (people who 
do business with hospitals),'' said Hospital Association V.P. Lauri Aldrete.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">And what do they get?
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A lot, according to Common Cause's Ruth Holten.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''These are not only the most powerful interests, they are also major campaign 
contributors, and the combination of the two makes them extremely powerful 
players in the state capital,'' Holten said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''And while they might not get everything that they want, they are very 
successful at blocking the things they don't want.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Which is just what they pay for.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">* PRESIDIO 2000:
</p><p class="body" align="Left">It's off the For Sale list for now, but if the Presidio goes back on the block 
for real, this may be what were looking at if the developers get their hands on 
it
</p><p class="body" align="Left">.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">* JUDICIAL GAMES
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Judge Lance Ito is looking for some thoughtful games for the O.J.  Simpson jury 
to play 
in their spare time. May we suggest: A) Clue B) Celebrity Jeopardy C) Dr. 
Wizard's Chemistry Set D) Mumblety-peg.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">* HAT TRICKS
</p><p class="body" align="Left">American politicians haven't worn hats since the days of Eisenhower -- and 
here's why:
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Pete Wilson: Chief Executive 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Dianne Feinstein: The Artist of Compromise
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Quentin Kopp: Conventioneer from Hell
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mike Dukakis: Iron Mike
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Frank Jordan: Former Police Chief
