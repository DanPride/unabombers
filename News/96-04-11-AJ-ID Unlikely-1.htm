</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A federal judge refused to unseal a search warrant Wednesday for 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> suspect Theodore Kaczynski's Montana cabin, and he also provided the first 
on-the-record confirmation that 
&quot;explosive devices&quot; were found there. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">U.S. District Judge Charles Lovell rejected a motion by several news 
organizations, saying he had agreed with a federal request to extend the search 
warrant through Monday. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;There were explosive devices and components which have necessitated very 
thorough examination by X-ray equipment,&quot; the judge said. 
&quot;The presence of these devices caused some delay in the execution of the warrant 
and the completion of the search.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Although a federal affidavit had described a partly constructed bomb, and 
anonymous sources have told reporters that one completed bomb was found as 
well, Lovell's remark was the first official confirmation. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The New York Times Co., the Denver Post Corp. and NBC had asked the judge to 
open the file on the warrant, arguing that there is no risk that evidence will 
be lost or 
<strong>witnesses</strong> influenced by making such information public. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The judge said he will consider opening the file at 
&quot;either the conclusion of the search or the return of a grand jury indictment, 
whichever comes first.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Assistant U.S. Attorney Bernard Hubley said there is no First Amendment right 
of access to search warrant materials prior to indictment, and he argued that 
releasing the information would hamper the investigation. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Kaczynski, a 53-year-old former mathematics professor, has been charged with 
possessing bomb components 
found in the cabin but not with any of the 16 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> attacks, which over 18 years killed three people and injured 23 in nine 
states. 


In other developments: 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">-Federal agents searching the cabin found aviator sunglasses and a sweatshirt 
similar to those seen by the only known 
<strong>witness</strong> to a 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> attack, newspapers in Chicago and San Francisco reported Wednesday. The 
Chicago Tribune and the San Francisco Examiner, citing an unidentified law 
enforcement official, said the shirt and glasses were found Tuesday. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The newspapers also said Kaczynski, who had no telephone, devised a mail code 
with his family to enable him to recognize important letters. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">-The FBI is warning certain possible 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> targets to remain wary of suspicious packages, after a bomb was found wrapped 
and ready for mailing at the cabin, NBC 
News reported Tuesday night. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> had promised to stop all attacks if either The New York Times or The 
Washington Post published his 35,000-word manifesto attacking modern 
technology. The papers complied, but the discovery of the wrapped bomb in 
Kaczynski's cabin led authorities to wonder whether more attacks were imminent, 
NBC said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">-An eyewitness who gave authorities their only physical description of the 
elusive bomber is unlikely to be able to positively 
<strong>identify</strong> Kaczynski - if he is the same man - unless his beard is shaved before he is 
put in a lineup, a Salt Lake City police investigator who has worked on the 
case for nine years. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Officer Kyle Jones, the department's Unabomb Task Group case manager, said he 
has seen two photographs of Kaczynski since the Lincoln, Mont., recluse was 
arrested and believes he is a 
&quot;plausible look-alike,&quot; based on his interviews of the only eyewitness. But Jones said in an interview 
that, without seeing Kaczynski cleanshaven, he could not be certain.
