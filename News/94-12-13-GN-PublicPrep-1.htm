</p><p class="body" align="Left"> ONE of the most baffling cases of recent times has re-surfaced after it 
emerged that a prominent advertising executive killed in an explosion at the 
weekend was the latest victim of a brilliant bomber with a vendetta against 
modern technology.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Federal investigators say the device which killed Thomas Mosser, executive 
vice -president of Young and Rubicam, bore all the hallmarks of the bomber 
codenamed 
<strong>Unabom</strong> because of a string of attacks mostly against university lecturers stretching 
back to 1978. The FBI is offering a $ 1 million reward for information leading 
to his arrest.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Mr Mosser, aged 50, was reported to have been decapitated after opening a 
videotape-sized parcel at his New Jersey home on Saturday. He was the second 
person to die in the 15 bombings which also injured 23, maiming several.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> A team of FBI agents has criss-crossed the country hunting the bomber since 
his first device exploded on the campus of Northwestern University in Illinois, 
injuring a security guard. Since then his victims have included academics 
prominent in the fields of computer sciences, genetics and psychology as well 
as targets linked to the airline industry.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Based on one sighting and other shreds of evidence, investigators believe he 
is a reclusive white male in his thirties or early forties with knowlege of 
university life. He is also an explosives expert, fashioning bomb parts by hand 
to make them harder to be traced.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> It is thought his 
attacks are part of a Luddite campaign against technology.  The FBI says his 
bombs are usually engraved with the initials 
&quot;FC&quot;, thought to stand for an obscene remark about computers.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Last year the New York Times received a letter purporting to come from the 
bomber. It said the attacks had been carried out by 
&quot;an anarchist group calling ourselves FC&quot; and promised 
&quot;a newsworthy event&quot;. Shortly afterwards a Yale computer scientist and a University of California 
geneticist were injured in separate blasts.
