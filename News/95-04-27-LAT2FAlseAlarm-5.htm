PACKAGE FORCES PACKARD BELL TO EVACUATE 300

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A suspicious package addressed to computer giant Packard Bell's president 
forced about 300 workers to evacuate their Westlake Village offices for about 
three hours shortly after noon Wednesday.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A startled secretary noticed the package oozing fluid and, with recent bombings 
in mind, feared the worst.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The package turned out to be a leaky computer printing cartridge.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;It was nothing,&quot; said Al Justice, the company's security director. 
&quot;Everybody is a little on edge.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;People are more cautious about these things now,&quot; said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Diane Hecht. She said the 
department's bomb squad X-rayed the package and determined it to be harmless.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I think these calls are due to the way of the world these days,&quot; Hecht said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Ventura County Sheriff's Department has not responded to any bomb scares 
since the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building on April 19, a 
spokesman said. Ventura police checked the local FBI office after a bomb threat 
that day.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Wednesday's package was addressed to Packard Bell President Beny Alagem, 
heightening fear of a bomb. The so-called 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> killed a Sacramento timber industry lobbyist with a mail bomb Monday and has 
targeted other computer experts in the past 17 years.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Packard Bell plans to shut down its Westlake Village manufacturing operation by 
the end of this week as it completes its move to Sacramento. Some executive and 
administrative workers will remain in Westlake Village.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">About 700 employees are still working at the Westlake Village site, Justice 
said. PAUL ELIAS
