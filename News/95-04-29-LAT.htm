</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Slain timber lobbyist Gilbert Murray was remembered Friday as a man who loved 
his family and would have been uneasy with the national media attention brought 
by his death at the hands of the 
<strong>Unabomber.</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Murray, 47, was killed Monday afternoon when he opened a mail bomb that had 
arrived at the California Forestry Assn. office in downtown Sacramento.  
The FBI has attributed the attack to the serial killer known as the 
<strong>Unabomber.</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">More than 300 people attended the service at Mt. Vernon Memorial Park in 
suburban Fair Oaks, some standing outside in the rain.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Will Murray, 18, described his father as a 
&quot;logical, sensible and stubborn&quot; man who loved his family. 
&quot;He taught us about everyday life. . . . I don't know what we'll do without him. 
He'll always be in our thoughts, our hearts. I miss you Dad. I love you,&quot; he said, choking back sobs.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Murray is also survived by his wife, Connie, and 16-year-old son Gilbert. The 
family lives in suburban Roseville.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Rev. David Stare described Murray as a man others relied on.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;He would have hated that (attention) because he was a background kind of guy, a 
background kind of guy who had been thrown into the 
maelstrom,&quot; Stare said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The family released a statement expressing thanks for 
&quot;all the support we have received the last few days. Gil touched many lives, 
both professionally and personally.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Murray was the third person to die in 16 attacks attributed to the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> since 1978. Twenty-three people have been injured.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A trust fund has been established for the victim's sons. Donations can be 
mailed to Gilbert Murray Memorial Trust Fund, P.O. Box 624, Sacramento, Calif. 
95812.
