<strong>Unabomber</strong>

</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong></p><p class="body" align="Left">A mail bomb that killed a timber industry lobbyist in an office building about 
three blocks from the state Capitol appears to be the work of the notorious 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> the FBI said last night. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">No others were injured in the blast, which occurred about 2:20 p.m. yesterday 
in the one-story brick building of the California Forestry Association, 
officials said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The incident prompted inquiries early from Attorney General Janet Reno's office 
about possible links to last week's car bombing in Oklahoma City, but 
investigators here quickly dismissed that notion. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Local, state and federal investigators almost immediately began examining 
whether this incident could be linked to the Unabom case.  This would be the 
16th bomb set off by the so-called 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> across the country in 17 years, resulting in the third fatality.  The 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> is believed to 
operate out of Northern California.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Similarities observed strongly indicate that this is the work of the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong>&quot; said Richard Ross, special agent in charge of the FBI's Sacramento office. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">He said forensic evidence provided the link to the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> but he did not elaborate.  Other than confirming the bomb was sent through the 
U.S. Postal Service, Ross offered no other connection between yesterday's blast 
and the 
<strong>Unabomber.</strong> 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Authorities identified the victim as Gilbert Murray, chief lobbyist for the 
private organization.  Murray, 47, lived in the Sacramento suburb of Roseville 
with his wife and three children. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Ross said a multi-agency federal task force tracking the Unabom case from its 
headquarters in San Francisco will lead the investigation of the Sacramento 
bombing. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In one attack connected to the Unabom case in 1985, a worker at a computer 
rental store in Sacramento was killed when he 
picked up what appeared to be a block of wood.  In the most recent bombing, 
which occurred last December, a prominent advertising executive was killed when 
he opened a package at his home in North Caldwell, N.J. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Ross said there is a $1 million reward offered for the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> which was established in early 1994. He urged anyone with information on the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> to call the federal task force at 1-800-701-2662. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The horror of this situation is that this (bomb) was received in the mail. 
Unfortunately, its victim was not the intended addressee,&quot; Ross said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">He would wouldn't say who the bomb was addressed to or whether that person 
worked with the forestry association.  Unabom cases have often had some 
connection with wood, whether in the name or street address of a victim. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The California Forestry Association is a nonprofit trade association 
representing wood products companies and commercial 
forest landowners. In 1993, it filed a petition seeking to remove the northern 
spotted owl from the federal endangered species list. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Shortly after 2 p.m. yesterday, a shoebox-sized package wrapped in brown paper 
arrived with the association's normal mail delivery, according to authorities.  
Heavier than it would appear for its size, officials said the package was given 
by a female clerk to Murray, who took it to an office.  It exploded when he 
began opening it, they said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Gov. Pete Wilson said he was 
&quot;deeply angered and outraged&quot; by the tragedy. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;A civilized society cannot tolerate these sorts of heinous actions and we will 
bring all forces to bear to see that the perpetrator or perpetrators of this 
crime are swiftly brought to justice,&quot; Wilson said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">He said that state police are moving to maximize security for 
state buildings. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Six people were in the forest association's downtown building when the bomb 
exploded, officials said.  One association employee, who was five months 
pregnant, asked to be taken to the hospital because, authorities said, she was 
&quot;pretty shaken up.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The devastation is quite high for this one bomb,&quot; said Jan Dunbar, a division chief for the Sacramento Fire Department, who 
added that there appeared to be little fire damage in the 7,500-square-foot 
building. 
&quot;It blew doors off, it blew windows out.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;There's a lot of glass on the floor, ceiling tile and sheetrock blown off the 
walls.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Construction workers across the street said they heard what sounded like a 
sonic boom. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Then people started coming out . . . a couple were pretty shook up,&quot; said Scott Eldridge, who was working on the 
vacant Justice Department building under construction across the street. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Investigating the blast were officials from the Sacramento police and fire 
departments, FBI, U.S. Postal Service and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Sacramento Police spokesman Michael Heenan said officials from Reno's office 
called to inquire about any possible links to last week's Oklahoma bombing 
outside a federal building. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Asked before Ross' announcement whether if the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> might be a suspect, Heenan said 
&quot;obviously that name comes up when you talk about a bomb and a mail bomb at that.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> targets have included universities, professors, airline companies and computer 
stores. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">For two years, a San Francisco-based task force of two dozen agents from the 
FBI, Treasury Department, and Post Office has pored over travel records, tips, 
interviews, lab results and case records searching for clues. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">He could easily buy the electrical switches he has used to kill three people 
and injure 23. Instead, he painstakingly builds them himself. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">One FBI agent says the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> earned that name because he initially targeted university and airline 
officials. Investigators believe the bomber is white, male, 40ish, quiet, 
antisocial and very meticulous.
