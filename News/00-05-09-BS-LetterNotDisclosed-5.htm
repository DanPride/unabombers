</p><p class="body" align="Left">MIAMI -- Cuban exiles angry over the new U.S. policy of sending back all Cuban 

boat people shut down a Miami expressway yesterday as the first group of 13 

refugees awaited their forced return. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">Eastbound traffic on busy Highway 836 was backed up for several miles for about 

45 minutes as exiles waved Cuban flags and massed in front of a tollbooth at 

noon. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;This is a betrayal of all the principles,&quot; said Francisco 

&quot;Pepe&quot; Hernandez, president of the Cuban American National Foundation.  



</p><p class="body" align="Left">For more than 30 years, refugees from Fidel Castro's Cuba have been given 

political asylum in the United States. 





Thousands of bunk beds expected to be recalled 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">Hundreds of thousands of wooden bunk beds are expected to be recalled 

nationwide because of a potentially deadly hazard that could entrap young 

children. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said it would release details of 

the recall, likely to involve several companies, at a news conference this 

morning. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">Twenty-four children died between 1990 and 1994 in similar beds 

&quot;when they became trapped and strangled&quot; between parts of the upper bunk, a commission statement said. The recall 

apparently stems from findings by the commission's staff last year that 17 of 

85 makers or importers of bunk beds surveyed had what a staff member called 

&quot;obvious&quot; entrapment hazards. 





6 die as small 

plane crashes in southwest Utah 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">SALT LAKE CITY -- A plane crashed and burned Sunday in the mountains of 

southwestern Utah, killing all six people aboard, authorities said. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">The plane, a Cessna 210, had taken off from Provo and was bound for Visalia, 

Calif., the Federal Aviation Administration said. 





12,000 Ore. state workers strike in 3-day job action 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">SALEM, Ore. -- Drivers couldn't renew their licenses yesterday and the 

unemployed couldn't check job listings after 12,000 unionized state employees 

walked off the job for a three-day strike. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">Oregon Public Employee Union members picketed state office buildings to demand 

a pay raise to offset a two-year wage freeze and a 6 percent pension 

contribution that takes effect 

in July. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">Management employees filling in for striking workers were able to keep state 

mental hospitals operating, along with other critical services such as 

protecting abused children, said Mark Fryburg, a state spokesman. However, the 

Department of Motor Vehicles closed 65 of its 66 branch offices. 





FBI confirms 

<strong>Unabomber</strong> sent letter to geneticist 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">SAN FRANCISCO -- A letter received by a Nobel Prize-winning geneticist was sent 

by the 

<strong>Unabomber</strong> on the same day as a package bomb that killed another man, the FBI confirmed 

yesterday. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bomber sent four letters from Oakland on April 20 when he mailed the most 

recent bomb. One of the letters went to Richard J. Roberts at New England 

Biolabs in Beverly, Mass., near Boston. 

&quot;The contents will not be disclosed,&quot; said 

Jim Freeman, head of the FBI in San Francisco. 



</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 

<strong>Unabomber</strong> has previously struck at a geneticist, injuring Dr. Charles Epstein of the 

University of California at San Francisco with a bomb sent to his home in 1993.
