Why are America's scientists afraid to open their mail? Because, writes Ian 
Katz, the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> lovingly crafted devices have been killing and maiming them for 17 years and 
federal investigators are nowhere near catching him 


</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> Ian Katz 


</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
 
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> IT IS A detail that now seems more grotesque than ironic but several staff 
members who passed through the reception of the California Forestry Association 
that afternoon joked that the shoe-box sized package looked like a bomb. It was 
wrapped in brown paper and addressed to William Dennison, who had retired as 
the association's president a year earlier. The receptionist had trouble 
removing the nylon tape so she took it through to her boss, Gilbert Murray. A 
few seconds later he was dead.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The blast in the association's Sacramento offices sent a shiver of panic 
through the country. The TV stations, still covering the six-day-old Oklahoma 
tragedy, broadcast the pictures from California as quickly as they could get 
them. Had the terrorists struck again, the anchors wondered aloud? Could it be 
that Oklahoma was just the beginning of a concerted terror campaign?  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
Almost as soon as he heard the details of the Sacramento explosion, FBI special 
agent Jim Freeman knew it had nothing to do with the Mid-Western attack. The 
explosion bore all the hallmarks of an ingenious serial killer who has eluded 
one of the most intensive FBI manhunts for almost 17 years. Freeman knew it 
long before the familiar report had come back from the FBI's explosives 
laboratory in Washington: the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> had struck again. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> At first sight, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> saga looks like a script custom written for Dennis Hopper. He is a twisted 
explosives expert who fashions his lethal contraptions with the loving care of 
a master craftsman. He harbours a grudge against technology and particularly 
hates computers. He picks his targets carefuly because of their association 
with ideas or developments he despises. He has struck 16 times, leaving a trail 
of mangled hands and three corpses. But there is a problem which will keep the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> off cinema screens for some time. He hasn't been caught. Not even close.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Freeman grimly initiated the ritual he had already performed three times since 
taking over as head of the San Francisco-based 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> task force in 1993. He appealed to the public for help and circulated the 
agency's eight-year-old composite sketch 
showing a moustachioed man in his late 20's with reddish hair under a hooded 
sweatshirt.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Privately, however, agents admitted they had little to go on. One conceded the 
sketch was &quot;pretty crappy&quot;. Rick Smith, a special agent in the San Francisco office, described the 
frustration felt by many: 
&quot;We don't know what his motivation is. We don't know what his demands are. It's 
so damned difficult.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Within hours, however, the 17 year investigation had been turned on its head. 
A secretary at the New York Times had become suspicious of an envelope which 
arrived in the paper's newsroom the same afternoon as the Sacramento bombing. 
The paper handed it over to the FBI who tested it for explosives. Instead they 
found a letter from the 
<strong>Unabomber.</strong> To prove it was not a hoax, he had included a nine digit identification 
number used on his only other public communication, a brief note to the paper 
in 1993 warning of future attacks.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> As he had in the earlier missive, the bomber referred to himself in the first 
person plural, even though the FBI has long been convinced that he operates 
alone. For the first time he outlined his motivation, describing himself as an 
anarchist who 
&quot;would like, ideally, to break down all society into very small, completely 
autonomous units.&quot; Since that was an abstract and distant goal, he explained, he had a more 
modest short-term aim - 
&quot;the destruction of the worldwide industrial system&quot;.  
<a name="Shrapnel"></a>
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> He described in detail how he had refined his bomb-making technique over the 
years and boasted that he could now make both small, lighter devices, and 
larger more deadly ones. 
&quot;Clearly we are in a position to do a great deal of damage,&quot; he taunted. 
&quot;And it 
doesn't appear the FBI is going to catch us any time soon. The FBI is a joke.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> All of which was to set the stage for an extraordinary Faustian proposition. 
<a href="http://www.unabombers.com/#Shrapnel">He was &quot;getting tired of making bombs&quot;. It was 
&quot;no fun having to spend all your evenings and weekends preparing dangerous 
mixtures, filing trigger mechanisms out of scraps of metal or searching the 
sierras for a place isolated enough to test a bomb.&quot; </a>So if the Times, or another 
&quot;widely read, nationally distributed periodical&quot; would publish a lengthy article by him, he would 
&quot;permanently desist from terrorist activities.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The article was between 29,000 and 37,000 words long, so he figured it might 
have to be serialised. Alternatively it could be published as a book, but it 
would have to be made widely available and moderately priced. The publisher 
could keep all profits but rights would revert to the public after 
six months. Each year for three years, the New York Times, Times or Newsweek 
would be obliged to print a 3,000 word piece by the bomber 
&quot;clarifying our material or rebutting criticisms of it.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> For the editor of the New York Times and the other publications named, the 
bomber's letter posed a prickly dilemma. Reject the offer outright and they 
risked having blood on their hands. Accept his bargain and they would flout one 
of the most fundamental precepts of journalistic ethics. But the team hunting 
the bomber were quietly elated. In the Times letter, the bomber noted that he 
had posted three other letters, one of them to a Yale computer scientist who 
was severely injured in one of his previous attacks. The letters didn't tell 
investigators his identity, but, for the first time, they offered a window on 
his soul.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> It will be exactly 17 
years, next Thursday, May 25, since the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> first attack. A woman spotted a parcel in a parking lot at the University of 
Illinois in Chicago. It was addressed to a professor at New York's Rensselaer 
Polytechnic Institute but bore a return address at the nearby Northwestern 
Univesity, so she sent it there. The academic whose name appeared on the 
envelope said he hadn't mailed it, so it was passed to the campus security 
office where it exploded, slightly injuring a university policeman.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> CAMPUS detectives conducted a routine investigation but it wasn't until 
November of the following year, when a bomb exploded in the cargo hold of an 
American Airlines flight bound for Washington, that federal authorities 
realised they were facing a serial bomber. When 
bomb experts sent photographs of its remains to Chicago, the origin of the 
flight, police there recognised similarities to another device which had 
exploded on the Northwestern campus a few months earlier, injuring a student. 
Then they linked it to the first attack in May 1978. When the bomber struck 
again the next summer, injuring the head of United Airlines with a device 
mailed to his home, they had a pattern. All the bomber's targets had been 
linked with either universities or airlines: they called him the 
<strong>Unabomber.</strong>  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The packages arrived with depressing regularity for almost seven years. At the 
University of California in Berkeley, an electronics professor was seriously 
injured in the face and hands when he picked up what appeared to be a measuring 
instrument. A few years later a mathematics graduate student at the same 
university opened a box. The explosion blew off the fingers of his 
right hand. At the University of Michigan, a research assistant was hurt when 
she opened a package addressed for a professor.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Then in December 1986, a device hidden under wooden boards in a parking lot 
killed a computer store owner in Sacramento, California. The mad bomber had 
become a murderer. Mysteriously, he appeared to abandon his terror campaign for 
more than six years between February 1987 and May 1993. But then two bombs in 
1993 seriously injured a University of California geneticist and a Yale 
computer expert. In December of last year Burson Marsteller executive Thomas 
Mosser was decapitated as he opened a package at his New Jersey home. Now 
Gilbert Murray, a genial, middle-aged father of two.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> In all this time the 
bomber has been seen only once, spotted fleetingly by a clerk as he planted the 
bomb which maimed a Salt Lake City computer store owner in February 1987. The 
clerk told police enough to produce a composite sketch. But with his wide dark 
glasses and unremarkable features, the figure in the now familiar picture looks 
hopelessly generic.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> And as federal authorities revealed last week that the bomber had written to 
two leading geneticists, security was being stepped up at universities across 
the country. Agents confirmed that the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> had sent letters to Richard Roberts, who runs a Boston biotechnology 
laboratory, and Phillip Sharp, a Massachussetts Institute of Technology 
researcher. The two men shared a 1993 Nobel prize for their work on the nature 
of DNA. They were lucky, the FBI said; in the past the bomber 
hasn't extended his victims the courtesy of a warning.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> What little federal investigators know about their quarry has been gleaned 
from the remnants of his handiwork, his choice of targets and, more recently, 
his letters. A glass cabinet at the explosives unit of the FBI headquarters in 
Washington contains replicas of most of his devices. The most revealing thing 
about them, say FBI and Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) experts 
who have worked on the case, is that every component has been painstakingly 
handcrafted.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Even where household items such as pins and screws could be easily purchased, 
the bomber has gone to the trouble of making them from scratch. 
&quot;These little devices are a reflection of himself and he is taking great pains 
to make them,&quot; said Christopher Ronay, who worked on the case for 14 years before retiring as 
the head of the FBI's explosives laboratory last year. 
&quot;He takes pride in them because they're his handwork.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> On several 
metal bomb parts, the bomber had inscribed the initials FC, the name he later 
used in his letters. Investigators speculate that the 
&quot;C&quot; stands for computers and the 
&quot;F&quot; for an expletive. More intriguingly, forensic experts found scratches on many 
components suggesting that the bomber marked pieces to allow him to dismantle 
and reassemble his devices.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
&quot;It gives you a picture of someone who is compulsive,&quot; says Ronay. 
&quot;He's doing these things not because he has to but because he enjoys it or feels 
a compulsion to do it. I picture someone bent over a bench late at night 
tinkering with the things. I've talked to a lot of bombers, but the way he's 
doing this is a whole different approach. He may even be talking to himself 
while he makes them.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> OVER the years, bomb experts noted another, unmistakable thread running 
through the devices. Every 
one contained hand-carved wooden components and most were placed in wooden 
boxes. The bomber has used a range of different hardwoods, even including a 
twig from a cherry tree. The wood theme carries over to some targets: the 
United Airlines chief injured back in 1980 was called Percy Wood; another 
victim lived on a road called Aspen Drive.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> In the early days he used match heads and gun powder extracted from bullets 
for explosives and elastic bands as detonators.  Now he uses electric triggers 
and a far deadlier mix of ammonium nitrate and alumnium powder. 
&quot;He's done his own testing and development,&quot; said Warren Parker, an ATF explosives expert. 
&quot;I'm sure he's read all the current literature, both underground and commercial. 
He's read the old stuff to.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Along with the 
remnants of his bombs, investigators have minutely analysed his choice of 
victims for any hint of his identity. They combed student records for anyone 
who might have born a personal grudge against the academics who received his 
packages. Then they trawled airline records for people who had been bumped from 
flights operated by the carriers he appeared to be targeting. They speculated 
that he may have lost his job to a computer, leaving him with a violent 
antipathy towards modern technology.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> In his letter to the New York Times last month, the bomber was obligingly 
specific. Suggestions that he was attacking scholars and universities in 
general were 
&quot;misleading&quot;, he complained. 
&quot;We would not want anyone to think that we have any desire to hurt professors 
who study archaeology, history, literature or harmless stuff like that.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> According to Professor Michael Rustigan, an expert in serial killers at San 
Fransisco State 
University, the bomber closely fits the profile of the so-called 
&quot;missionary&quot; killer: 
&quot;These are people who murder with a moral masquerade. He's on this personal 
mini-war against corporate capitalism.&quot; Like the FBI, Rustigan is convinced that the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> is a loner (agents point out that his time-consuming hobby would leave little 
time for socialising) and highly intelligent.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Rustigan believes the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> latest attack and rare volubility may have been triggered by jealousy over the 
media attention paid to the Oklahoma bombing. 
&quot;He probably felt that his reputation as the most sinister serial bomber was 
suddenly being upstaged by this amateur, Timothy McVeigh.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> At its headquarters on the 12th floor of San Francisco's FBI building, Jim 
Freeman's task force, bolstered since the Murray killing by a further 100 
agents, doesn't much care what made him start 
writing. They just hope he will carry on. They all know it was an exchange of 
correspondence with a newspaper that finally led police to George Metesky, 
America's most famous serial bomber.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> In the meantime they are painstakingly feeding every scrap of information they 
have about the bomber into a giant new computer, the most powerful ever used in 
law enforcement. They hope it will tell them something, if only where he is 
likely to strike next. Rustigan relishes the irony in this approach: 
&quot;Here's a guy who hates computers. And now it might well be a computer that 
busts him.&quot;
