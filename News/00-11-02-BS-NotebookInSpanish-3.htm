 Agency is facing translation backlog

</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">When FBI agents raided Theodore J. Kaczynski's remote Montana cabin in April 
1996, they found thousands of handwritten pages that eventually unmasked the 
reclusive, Harvard-trained mathematician as the 
<strong>Unabomber.</strong> But there was a problem: Hundreds of the documents were written in Spanish or 
in a meticulous numerical code that even when broken translated to Spanish 
instead of English. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> In time, the cryptic journals formed the cornerstone of the government's case 
against Kaczynski. But at the Montana cabin that spring, where agents also had 
found an assembled bomb, investigators feared the pages contained plans for 
targeting victims beyond the three people already killed and 23 injured. They 
needed to quickly learn what the journals said.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> That job fell to a team of 20 FBI translators, who spread out at cafeteria 
tables inside the bureau's Washington headquarters to unravel Kaczynski's 
writings. Their behind-the-scenes work had to be highly accurate and was so top 
secret that none of the federal authorities who worked on the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> case have previously publicly disclosed that much of what Kaczynski wrote was 
not in English.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
&quot;They worked day and night for months to translate these documents,&quot; said Special Agent Terry D. Turchie, who headed the San Francisco-based 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> Task Force. 
&quot;You can imagine how we felt when we could actually see admissions and 
confessions of the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> crimes.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> In one of the nation's most high-profile law enforcement agencies, this unseen 
work is increasingly in demand as federal agents investigate crimes that are 
ever-more global, such as the bomb attacks on the World 
Trade Center in New York, the U.S. embassies in Africa and, most recently, the 
destroyer USS Cole in Yemen.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Some 400 people work for the FBI's Language Services Section - double what the 
agency employed 10 years ago - and the bureau also contracts with more than 350 
independent linguists and translators. In this year's budget request to 
Congress, FBI Director Louis J. Freeh asked for an additional $<strong></strong>5 million to cover translation work for what he called 
&quot;short-term, mission-critical criminal and national security investigations.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
&quot;All the world has become smaller,&quot; said David E. Alba, the FBI assistant director who oversees the language 
division. 
&quot;With the modes of transportation being what they are, we have all kinds of 
people coming in, and all kinds of languages.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> A generation ago, FBI investigators turned to translators 
for help in predictable ways and with more conventional languages. Agents using 
wire-taps to crack some of the country's largest organized crime rings would 
employ translators when the recorded conversations veered, for example, from 
English to Italian. Along the Mexican border, agents made frequent use of 
Spanish-speaking translators.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Leo Vadala of Bowie, Md., grew up in an Italian-American family and earned a 
degree in Spanish studies before he came to the FBI as a language specialist 16 
years ago. He monitored wire taps in mob investigations out of Chicago, served 
as an interpreter for polygraph examiners and during interrogations with 
defendants, and helped agents pore over foreign-language documents.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The nature of the work has changed little in the 20 years since the FBI 
created a language 
services division. Arabic translators helping with the investigation of the 
1993 plot to bomb New York landmarks, after the attack on the World trade 
Center, discovered that the radical followers of Egyptian Sheik Omar Abdel 
Rahman were using the word 
&quot;Hadduta&quot; - which literally means a child's bedtime story - as a code for bombs. Alba 
said investigators knew something was up when the suspects talked about 
&quot;buying oil and fertilizer for the Haduttas.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> In the bureau's Baltimore field office, agents enlisted language specialists 
in 1998 as they investigated the rapes of five students from St. Mary's College 
of Maryland during a trip to Guatemala, where all of the police and court 
records were in Spanish.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> But the amount of work has sharply increased in recent years, as have requests 
for translators who know many of the world's more arcane languages - 
tongues such as Twi (Ghana), Igbo and Yoruba (both from south central 
Niger-Congo) or Farsi (Iran) - and who are available to travel to investigation 
sites at a moment's notice.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
&quot;What's making this a lot more interesting is there's an increasing demand for 
languages we haven't even heard of,&quot; Vadala said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
&quot;Knowing what (the languages) are and what country they're from is one hurdle,&quot; said Margaret R. Gulotta, section chief for language services. 
&quot;But finding someone who knows how to speak it is another thing.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The FBI's language specialists are not agents, but they must pass strict 
background checks and exhaustive fluency exams.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> In some cases, potential translators don't know the foreign language well 
enough to be effective in high-pressure situations where the criminals are 
unlikely to speak slowly or be helpful, Gulotta said. In other 
instances, potential translators, who frequently are foreign born, have limited 
English skills.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Another problem, Gulotta said, is that it can be very hard 
&quot;to find people on our side of the law.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> When agents discovered during the investigation of the 1998 African embassy 
bombings that they needed a translator for a highly unusual language, the 
bureau couldn't locate anyone in the federal government with security clearance 
to work on the case, she said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The Justice Department is developing universal language standards that would 
allow translators to work across law enforcement agencies. The department also 
plans to create a database of all available translators, their language skills 
and their security clearance. FBI officials are using the bureau's Web site 
(www.fbi.gov) to help recruit translators.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Still, the amount of work remains staggering, Alba told a congressional panel 
this fall.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Last 
year, FBI workers translated more than a million pages of documents and 
countless hours of audio tapes. And the work still is backing up, he said, with 
the delays potentially raising problems in time-sensitive criminal 
investigations.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
&quot;The lead value diminishes when the translation is delayed too long,&quot; Alba said. 
&quot;When we're talking about unaddressed work coming from critical national 
security-related investigations, the implications are sobering.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> That was true in the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> investigation, said Turchie, now the FBI's deputy assistant director for 
counter-terrorism. While the translated journals did not reveal any immediate 
threats, they did yield incredible confessions about his mail bombings that 
dated to 1978 and eventually led to Kaczynski's guilty pleas.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
&quot;The foundation of so much of the evidence was his own words,&quot; Turchie said.
