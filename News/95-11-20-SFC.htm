 Bomb Tensions Prompt Santa Rosa Evacuations

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Santa Rosa -- Heightened awareness of bombs by public officials prompted the 
evacuation of a state office building and a high school yesterday after three 
concrete cylinders were found partially buried in shrubbery.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said 
vigilance has been increased since the destruction of the federal building in 
Oklahoma City and the killing of a timber industry lobbyist in Sacramento who 
opened a parcel bomb sent by the 
<strong>Unabomber.</strong>  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The concrete cylinders may have been there for some time, said the CDF area 
chief Dean Lucke, but no one was taking any chances after the discovery shortly 
before 10 a.m. Authorities evacuated the 60 employees of the CDF regional 
office at 135 Ridgeway Avenue and 225 students and staff from nearby Ridgeway 
High School.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The cylinders, which measured about a foot long by 6 inches in diameter, were 
taken by the Santa Rosa bomb squad to an old naval airfield and blown up.
