</p><p class="subheader" align="left"><strong>HEADLINE:</strong> FBI Traces Tips On Serial Bomber 

 But agents are no closer to catching mystery killer 



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> Michael Taylor, Rob Haeseler, Chronicle Staff Wri 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI task force investigating the 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> slaying of a New Jersey advertising executive said yesterday that it has been 
deluged with telephone calls over its toll- free bomber line, receiving 3,100 
tips since Monday morning and sending agents to check personally on some 600 of 
them.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But so far, despite what the FBI called an extensive investigation of all leads 
that have poured in, nothing has brought agents closer to catching the bomber.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Pleading once again for public help in solving Saturday's killing of Thomas J. 
Mosser, as well as 14 other incidents since 1978 attributed to the mysterious 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> killer, the FBI's top agent in San Francisco, Jim Freeman, said the case will 
be cracked when members of the public notice or remember something about the 
few scanty clues in the case that 
so far may have seemed unimportant. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''We're encouraging the public to come forward,'' Freeman said, ''and we're 
utilizing publicity on a national scale, like the $ 1 million reward and the 
toll-free number.'' That number is 1-800-701-BOMB. Anonymity will be granted to 
callers.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The agents hope, for example, that someone might recognize a brief handwriting 
sample the FBI believes was written by the bomber last year and inadvertently 
included in a letter the bomber sent to the New York Times.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Freeman also revealed for the first time that the name on the return address on 
the package mailed December 3 from San Francisco to Mosser's home in North 
Caldwell, N.J., was H. C. Wickel. The typewritten return address was Department 
of Economics, San Francisco State University.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''No H. C. Wickel is, or has been, attached to San Francisco State, either as a 
professor or student,'' said Dennis Hagberg, the chief U.S. Postal Inspection 
Service officer in San Francisco. Even though the 45-agent 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> task force said it came up dry when it started 
checking out people with the last name of Wickel, Hagberg urged the public to 
''think if that name means anything to anybody, and contact our hotline.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''We've talked to families named Wickel,'' Freeman said, ''but that has been 
unproductive.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In fact, the use of a realistic- looking return address is a well- known part 
of the modus operandi of the 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> suspect, who is thought to be a white male in his late 30s or mid-40s. Other 
packages or letters he has mailed in the past had return addresses of people at 
various universities.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bomb that killed Mosser when he opened it in his kitchen was ''the size of 
two videotapes stacked together,'' said Paul Snabel, chief of the San Francisco 
office of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Snabel said task force investigators are asking people to recall whether they 
had any ''houseguests who asked them to mail 
something,'' or if they knew people who were in the Bay Area on temporary 
relocation from a job elsewhere. Snabel said the device that killed Mosser was 
a pipe bomb but that investigators have yet to find the initials ''FC,'' a clue 
found on pieces of other bombs the suspect has crafted in the past.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">One other clue was the phrase ''Call Nathan R Wed 7 pm,'' the writing 
impression that was lifted by laboratory technicians from a letter the bomber 
sent the Times in June 1993, at the same time two 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> bombs injured two professors, one in Tiburon and the other in New Haven, Conn.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Snabel said agents believe that ''it's a message, a notation he was making to 
himself or a family member.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">When it comes to bombings, California is the leader, the ATF says.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Between 1989 and 1993, the bureau counted 1,599 bombings and attempted bombings 
in California, representing 17 percent of all such incidents nationwide. For 
the same period, Florida came in second with 822 incidents, followed by 
Illinois, 617; Arizona, 472; and New York, 432. A total of 258 people died, 
including 70 in 1993.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Not only did California outpace all other states, but the number of bombings in 
the state nearly doubled between 1989, when 203 were recorded, and 1993, when 
405 occurred.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">New Jersey, where Mosser was killed, had only 191 bombing incidents from 
1989-93, accounting for a scant 2 percent of the national total.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Revenge -- said by the FBI and ATF to be the motive in the 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> bombings -- accounted for 1,119 explosive incidents and 974 incendiary ones 
in the five years analyzed by the ATF.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Until 1991, pipe bombs were most often used in destructive devices. They were 
outnumbered by bottles the following year. In the five-year period up to 1993, 
3,081 pipe bombs were responsible for 46 deaths and 391 injuries nationwide.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">According to the FBI, the 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> suspect has used pipe bombs in all but one of the 15 devices attributed to him.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The ATF reported 86 mail bomb incidents from 1989-93 that killed eight people 
and injured 47. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> FBI ASKS FOR PUBLIC'S HELP VIA INTERNET
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI has set up an Internet site for public help in its investigation of the 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> incidents.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The site, which contains information on the serial bomber and on the $ 1 
million reward offered for his capture, is reached two ways.  The 
first is by connecting to an Internet server and typing:
</p><p class="body" align="Left">telnet naic.nasa.gov
</p><p class="body" align="Left">login: gopher
</p><p class="body" align="Left">password: your e-mail address
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Choose No. 9 Government Resources off the menu
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Choose No. 11 FBI Gopher
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The site also may be reached with a World Wide Web browser. At the prompt, type 
in http://naic.nasa.gov/ fbi/ to get to the address.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI warned that it is a federal offense to leave false information or 
otherwise engage in unlawful actions at either address.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">People with information also may call the FBI's 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> Task Force at 1-800-701-2662.
