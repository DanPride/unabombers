</p><p class="body" align="Left">HELENA, Mont. (AP) - The search of 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> suspect Theodore Kaczynski's cabin yielded the names and addresses of 
corporate executives, street maps of the San Francisco area, bus schedules and 
several guns and explosive devices, an FBI document confirms.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In a filing released in U.S. District Court yesterday, the agency also 
confirmed published reports of three typewriters found in the cabin, as well as 
several unspecified writings. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">But the 34-page list does not specifically 
<strong>identify</strong> any of those documents as the original text of the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> manifesto. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Dozens of the entries on the list were for chemicals. A pipe bomb was found, 
along with at least four guns. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The list also described a hooded jacket, a blue zippered sweatshirt and hood 
and two pairs of plastic glasses. A 
<strong>witness</strong> who saw the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> plant one bomb described him as wearing a hooded sweatshirt and aviator 
glasses, resulting in the widely published artist's sketch. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Kaczynski, 53, was arrested at the cabin near Lincoln, Mont., two weeks ago and 
is being held on a 
single count of possessing bomb components. He has not been charged with any of 
the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> attacks. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bombings, over the past 18 years, killed three people and injured 23 in 
nine states. Three of the bombings occurred in the San Francisco Bay area.
