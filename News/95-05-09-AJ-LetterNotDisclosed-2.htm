</p><p class="body" align="Left">Widespread use of electric cars would reduce smog, but producing the lead-based 
batteries they now depend on would cause far more serious environmental 
problems, a researcher said in Pittsburgh today. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Emissions from mining, smelting and recycling the lead needed to make batteries 
for a large number of electric cars would expose those near industrial sites to 
toxic doses of lead, according to a study by researchers at Carnegie Mellon 
University. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;When we got the lead out of gasoline, it was a triumph for public health,&quot; researcher Chris Hendrickson said. 
&quot;I'd hate to see us slide back and release lots more lead in the environment.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In an article prepared for the May 19 issue of the journal Science, researchers 
say even taking into account advanced technology not yet available for electric 
cars, the production of batteries for an electric car would push six times as 
much lead into the environment as that emitted by a small automobile burning 
leaded gasoline, which has been phased out. 


MILITARY 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">SCHOOL OF AMERICAS UNDER STUDY: The Army has hired an independent contractor to 
evaluate the future of the School of the Americas after years of protests by 
church activists who branded the Fort Benning training facility for Latin 
American soldiers the 
&quot;school of assassins.&quot; But Lt. Col. Tom Begines, an Army spokesman, said Monday in Washington that 
the $ 23,572 contract awarded PROSOFT of Virginia Beach, Va., does not mean the 
Army is considering 
closing the controversial school, which has survived two votes in Congress in 
the past two years to eliminate its funding. A congressional study found that 
10 graduates of the school gained control of Latin American countries through 
military coups or other undemocratic means in the past 30 years. Other 
graduates have been linked to atrocities such as the 1989 murder of six Jesuit 
priests and two women in El Salvador. 


PEOPLE 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">RABIN MOURNS WITH FAMILY: Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin sat in Stephen 
Flatow's home in West Orange, N.J., and read letters Flatow's daughter sent 
from Israel about how she loved the country and its people. Alisa Flatow, 20, 
was killed in a suicide bombing in the Gaza Strip a month ago, but her family 
told Rabin they were still deeply devoted to 
Israel. 
&quot;I came to express my sympathy from all of the Israeli people,&quot; Rabin said after the 35-minute meeting. He also thanked the family for 
donating Flatow's organs to six Israelis. 


CRIME 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">EXECUTION ON: A federal appeals court denied a stay of execution for a Montana 
man who has been on death row for 20 years. On Monday, the 9th U.S. Circuit 
Court of Appeals voted 2-1 in Pasadena, Calif., against another delay in the 
execution of Duncan P. McKenzie, 43, convicted of the torture-murder of a rural 
Montana schoolteacher in 1974. McKenzie is to be executed by lethal injection 
Wednesday. McKenzie had previously won eight stays of execution. His lawyer 
says McKenzie has been on death row longer than any other inmate in the country 
and 
argued that the delay constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of 
the Constitution. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>UNABOMBER</strong> LETTER: A letter received by a 
Nobel Prize-winning geneticist was sent by the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> on the same day as a package bomb that killed another man, the FBI said 
Monday. The bomber sent four letters from Oakland, Calif., on April 20, when he 
mailed the most recent bomb. One of the letters went to Richard J. Roberts at 
New England Biolabs in Beverly, Mass., near Boston. 
&quot;The contents will not be disclosed,&quot; said Jim Freeman, head of the FBI's San Francisco office.
