</p><p class="body" align="Left"> POLICE investigating two high-tech bomb caches fear they could be hunting a 
British version of the American 
<strong>Unabomber.</strong> 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Explosives experts say the devices, found in Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire, 
are the most sophisticated 
&quot;home-made&quot; bombs discovered on British soil. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Their design is more advanced than any used by the IRA. Officers fear the 
skills in electronics and explosives needed to manufacture the units and the 
booby-trap systems attached to them, intended to kill bomb disposal experts, 
mean they are dealing with a bomber never encountered before. They also cannot 
be sure of the intended targets.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Police have a list of 17 possibilities for the types of group that could be 
responsible for the deadly anti-personnel devices, although senior officers 
believe that a lone bomber is the most likely source. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> In America, Ted Kaczynski, who was known as the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> was responsible for a series of seemingly random bombings over 18 years before 
being jailed for life after he was turned in by his brother. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The devices found in Britain have been studied by MI5, whose bomb experts 
describe them as having been made with 
&quot;loving care&quot; and 
&quot;by a new and original mind&quot;. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Acting Superintendent Euan Reid, who is leading the investigation by Thames 
Valley police, said: 
&quot;These must have taken weeks of determined, focused expertise to make. We are 
thankful they did not explode. They were designed to shred everything around 
them. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
&quot;The man who built these is clearly a 
perfectionist, is clearly very proud of them and is certainly very intelligent.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Forensic explosives experts from MI5, which has been consulted by police but 
is not involved in the investigation, said the bombs are almost certainly not 
related to Irish terrorism. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The eight anti-personnel devices were made up of tightly packed explosives, 
complex electronics, and large numbers of steel nuts. They were packed into 
plastic water bottles and included 
&quot;trembler&quot; mechanisms to set off the detonators if they were moved. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The bombs were designed to have a devastating effect within a 50ft radius, 
spraying the nuts in the same way as a military fragmentation grenade. The 
result would have been even more deadly if they were used indoors in a crowded 
environment such as a pub. The explosive used has not yet been identified. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> They were found freshly buried in an Oxfordshire wood last weekend by a man 
walking his dog. The 
first device, discovered on a stone wall at a farm 30 miles away in 
Gloucestershire the previous Sunday, was possibly a test unit. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Officers from both counties, as well as anti-terrorist detectives from 
Scotland Yard, are taking part in the hunt. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> They are working with the Ministry of Defence and companies which use 
explosives to see if any former soldiers or members of staff could be suspects. 
They are convinced that it would have taken professional expertise - and 
sophisticated tools - to assemble the bombs. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Detectives are preparing a psychological profile of the would-be bomber which 
they hope will go some way towards explaining why the devices were left where 
they were and what the intended targets may have been. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
&quot;Motive is the hardest thing to establish,&quot; said one detective on the team. 
&quot;We could be looking at a new terror group with similar political intentions to 
an established group, or we might be facing a lone bomber. 
Whoever it is, they are very capable and that is the most worrying thing.&quot;
