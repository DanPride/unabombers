 FBI says killer may live in Northern California 



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> Catherine Bowman, Michael Taylor, Chronicle Staff 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The innocuous-looking package bomb that killed an advertising executive in New 
Jersey was mailed from San Francisco 10 days ago, and the notorious 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> killer who sent it may very well live in a Northern California community, the 
FBI said yesterday.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Jim Freeman, special agent in charge of the FBI's San Francisco office, asked 
the public to ''examine the possibility that the 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> suspect does live in one of our communities.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI, which is working on the 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> case jointly with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the 
Postal Service, urged anyone with information about the bomber to call the 
toll-free hotline, 1-800-701- BOMB. Anonymity will be granted, and informants 
will be given identification numbers. A $ 1 million reward has been offered.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>UNABOM</strong> is the name given by federal agents to a mysterious bomber who has killed two 
men and injured 23 other people in a 16-year terror campaign that appears to be 
aimed at universities, airlines and computer-related enterprises. The most 
recent incident occurred Saturday when Thomas J.  Mosser, the recently named 
general manager and executive vice president of Young 
&amp; Rubicam in New York, was killed in his North Caldwell, N.J., home when he 
opened a package that has been identified as a bomb created by the 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> perpetrator. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The revelation that the Mosser bomb was mailed from San Francisco now means 
that of the 15 incidents attributed to the bomber, seven either were mailed 
from or exploded in Northern California. The bomber also mailed a letter to the 
New York Times from Sacramento last year at about the time two of his 
devices injured professors in Marin County and at Yale University in New Haven, 
Conn.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The small package that exploded in at Mosser's kitchen bore a postmark date of 
Saturday, December 3, and arrived at Mosser's home on Friday, December 9. He 
did not open the package until the next day. It had a San Francisco return 
address, but FBI agents said a cursory check indicates ''there is not a person 
by that name at that particular location.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">TIMING IMPORTANT
</p><p class="body" align="Left">When the package was mailed is important because some investigators have 
speculated that the bomber has, of late, been choosing his victims from the 
pages of newspapers. Mosser's promotion to his new post was mentioned in the 
Wall Street Journal one day before the bomb was mailed.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Freeman said agents are still reconstructing fragments of the packaging. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">An FBI 
press conference yesterday was the second in as many days to discuss the 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> case. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''I want the general public to be particularly alert,'' Freeman said, adding it 
is ''very pertinent'' that the 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> killer has been in Northern California, Utah and Illinois, perhaps for short 
periods.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''He certainly has a familiarity with the Bay Area and San Francisco.  Whether 
or not he is a full- time resident, I don't know,'' Freeman said. ''He may even 
appear to be a very nice guy. (He) could easily be the person living next 
door.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Packages carrying bombs through the mail bore postage stamps, indicating that 
the suspect probably affixed them himself to avoid contact with a postal clerk. 
Not all of the packages are alike, and the bomber has used different methods of 
detonation.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''There has been a progression in the sophistication of devices . . . and the 
destructiveness of the explosions,'' Freeman said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Word Out on the Internet
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
FBI also said it has been putting out the word about 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> on the Internet to reach as many people as possible and because of the 
possibility the bomber has been involved with the world of computers. The FBI 
has yet to identify a suspect.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">FBI agents are warning the public to be alert to any suspicious packages -- 
those that are unexpected, bear an unfamiliar return address or no return 
address at all.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''To allay any widespread public concern, it should be noted that all mailed 
devices thus far have targeted specific individuals.''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Since the first bomb exploded on a university campus in Chicago in 1978, 
investigators have been stumped by the bomber. Freeman said eight of the bombs 
have been mailed to individuals, and seven others placed in areas where they 
would be disturbed and detonate.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Although Mosser's death apparently is a departure from other 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> incidents -- in that Mosser was in the advertising business -- 
clues can be found in the timing of recent events connected to both Mosser and 
Young 
&amp; Rubicam, investigators noted.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Six of the bombings, including the December 1985 killing of Hugh Campbell 
Strutton in Sacramento, were connected to computers. Strutton owned a computer 
store, and the other victims, none of whom died, either were computer 
professors or worked in university computer science buildings.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Computer-Related Clients
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In November, there were brief announcements in the New York Times that Young 
&amp; Rubicam had picked up two computer-related firms as clients -- Massachusetts- 
based Digital Equipment Corp. and the Desktop Document Systems division of 
Xerox Corp., of Palo Alto. Three days after the Xerox Corp. announcement, the 
Wall Street Journal ran its story about Mosser's promotion to the top job at 
Young 
&amp; Rubicam.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The computer link in the 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> case is being considered seriously by investigators, who have been pondering 
the meaning of the initials, ''FC,'' which have appeared on at least seven of 
the bomber's devices. The initials also appeared in the letter the bombmaker 
sent the New York Times.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Michael Reynolds, who spent a year researching the case for a Playboy magazine 
article said the federal 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> task force has run down 5,000 leads and amassed a list of 200 suspects, all to 
no avail. Disguised as videotape cassettes, manuscripts, books and even 
construction debris, the bombs were crafted from pieces virtually impossible to 
trace. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''This guy has taken a great deal of time and patience to construct (these 
bombs) from parts you normally would buy off the shelf,'' said Paul Snabel, 
ATF's top agent in San Francisco. ''He is building them from scratch. . . . He 
has a very fastidious nature. He's 
a very compulsive type.''
