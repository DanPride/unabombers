FBI agents find names of execs, maps in cabin

</p><p class="body" align="Left">FBI agents searching 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> suspect Theodore Kaczynski's cabin found addresses of corporate executives and 
scientists, maps of San Francisco, bus schedules, guns and a bottle of anti- 
depressant medicine, according to an inventory released Monday. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In a filing released in federal court, the FBI also confirmed published reports 
of three typewriters found in the cabin, as well as several unspecified 
documents and notes. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">However, none of the documents were identified as the original text of the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> manifesto, the 35,000-word tract published in The Washington Post last year. 
The Associated Press reported last week that agents found what appeared to be 
the original of the diatribe against modern technology.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">FBI agents also found the names of about 25 University of California- Berkeley 
mathematics professors, according to campus police Capt. William Foley. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Foley said the FBI told him late last week the names were handwritten on 
notebook paper and asked him for campus addresses so they could meet with the 
faculty members. About half are retired or semi- retired professors who were at 
Berkeley when Kaczynski taught there in the late 1960s. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Kaczynski, 53, was arrested at the cabin near Lincoln two weeks ago and is 
being held on charges of possessing bomb components. He has not been charged 
with any of the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> attacks, which killed three people and injured 23. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In its list, the FBI did not specifically link any of the more than 600 items 
to the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> or his crimes and did not even use the word 
&quot;<strong>Unabomber.</strong>&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">One item simply read: 
&quot;One 'Calumet Baking Powder' can containing soldering wire.&quot; Another specified a pair of brown and green hiking boots with a brand name, 
Northwest Territory. One entry said 
&quot;letters;&quot; another read simply 
&quot;documents.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Dozens of the entries were for chemicals. A pipe bomb was found, as was an 
&quot;improvised explosive device&quot; in a cardboard box, and five guns. Among the weapons were a .25-caliber gun, 
bolt-action .22-caliber rifle, Remington model .30-06, .22 caliber black-handle 
revolver and a hand-made gun.  The list doesn't 
<strong>identify</strong> the corporate executives or give the addresses. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A bottle of Trazadone, a prescription anti-depressant drug, was found. The 
Physician's Desk Reference recommends the drug for patients who have suffered a 
&quot;major depressive episode.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The list also 
described a hooded jacket, a blue zippered sweatshirt and hood and two pairs of 
plastic glasses. A 
<strong>witness</strong> who saw the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> plant one bomb described him as wearing a hooded sweatshirt and aviator 
glasses, resulting in the widely circulated sketch. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The references to San Francisco and to corporate executives were cryptic. The 
item was listed as: 
&quot;One 'Aldrich' box containing misc. papers, newspaper clippings, bus schedule, 
addresses of corporate officials and maps of San Francisco.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The references may be significant because the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> who raged against modern technology, targeted executives. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Three of the bombings occurred in the San Francisco Bay area and two in 
Sacramento. Five of the bombs were mailed from Northern California, including 
two from Oakland and one from San Francisco.
