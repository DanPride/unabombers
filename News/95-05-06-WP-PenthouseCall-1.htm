</p><p class="body" align="Left">* A judge in Columbia, S.C., terminated the four-year marriage of David and 
Susan V. Smith, the woman who confessed to drowning their two little boys in a 
lake. Susan Smith, 23, faces trial on two murder charges.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">* A man described as a 
&quot;narco-terrorist&quot; for killing 110 people with a bomb he planted on a Colombian jetliner was 
sentenced to 10 life prison terms. The Avianca flight blew up over Bogota on 
Nov. 27, 1989. In 1991, Dandeny Munoz-Mosquera, already in prison on other 
charges, was indicted in the case. Munoz-Mosquera was portrayed at his trial in 
New York as a hired killer and drug smuggler in the violent Medellin cartel. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">* Quartzsite, Ariz., Mayor Rex Byrd faces up to life in prison after being 
found guilty of trying to plot the death of a political rival. Jurors found 
Byrd, 71, guilty Thursday of conspiring to have his predecessor in the mayor's 
office, Richard Oldham, killed. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">* Penthouse publisher Bob 
Guccione, who offered to publish a lengthy manifesto from the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> thinks he might have received a call from the elusive bomber, who has killed 
three people and injured 23 others in 16 bombings since 1978. Federal 
investigators said they want to talk to Guccione about the call, but the 
publisher said he will not cooperate with the FBI.</p>
