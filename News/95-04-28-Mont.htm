</p><p class="body" align="Left">FBI agents scoured area machine shops yesterday for clues in the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> case, trying to determine whether the bomber used any of the shops to make 
explosives, a federal investigator said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The investigator - a Unabomb task force member - would not say why agents 
suspect that the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> might have used one of the shops. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The San Francisco FBI has temporarily reassigned 100 agents to work on the task 
force that is poring over old and new clues in the 17-year-old case. FBI 
director Louis Freeh has agreed to put an additional 50 agents on the case.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The latest blast, on Monday, killed Sacramento timber industry lobbyist Gilbert 
Murray, 47, as he opened a package addressed to a former employee of the Timber 
Association of California. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;From what we can see, it seems the most powerful yet&quot; in the string of 16 bombings since 1978, said Robert Barnett, head of the 
federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms office here. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">ATF investigators were still trying to determine what explosives were used in 
Monday's attack. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bomb was encased in a wooden box similar to the bomb that killed New Jersey 
advertising executive Thomas Mosser in December, Barnett said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">All told, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> has killed three people and injured 23. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bomb that killed Murray was mailed along with four letters from the Oakland 
area one day after the Oklahoma City bombing. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI has not made 
public the names of the recipients of two letters, or revealed the contents. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Of the other two, one letter critical of 
&quot;industrial society&quot; went to the New York Times. The other went to a Yale University computer- 
science professor badly injured in an earlier bombing. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Also yesterday, the FBI denied TV reports that agents were searching for former 
Symbionese Liberation Army member James William Kilgore as a possible suspect 
in the case. Kilgore was a bomb-maker for the SLA, the group responsible for 
kidnapping Patty Hearst. He went underground in 1975 and was never caught. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">This is not the first time authorities have stepped up efforts to crack the 
case that has stumped investigators for 17 years. In December, after a package 
bomb Mosser at his New Jersey home, the FBI assigned additional investigators 
to the 
case and appealed to the public to come forward with tips. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">But with the appearance of four letters sent by the self-professed anarchist 
last week, agents are more confident than ever that they will catch him, said 
Jim R. Freeman, FBI chief for San Francisco.
