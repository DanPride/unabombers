</p><p class="body" align="Left">Thomas J. Mosser spent much of his career advising clients like Johnson 
&amp; Johnson on what to say publicly during a crisis.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But investigators and colleagues at Young 
&amp; Rubicam were at a loss Monday to explain why the 50-year-old Madison Avenue ad 
executive was the target Saturday of a mail bomb attack.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The suspect, known only as 
<strong>Unabom,</strong> previously targeted people connected to universities, airlines or computers.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI says it is reviewing Mosser's client list, which over the years has 
included several airlines as well as Xerox Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mosser was an expert in crisis management. He handled Coca-Cola's unsuccessful 
introduction of its New Coke product and later the return of Coca-Cola Classic.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He also handled damage control during the Tylenol tampering case and assisted 
Perrier when traces of benzine were found in the sparkling water.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;You could tell a lot about him by looking at his work,&quot; says long-time friend Dennis Shaw. 
&quot;He told Tylenol to step forward and reassure the public. . . . He was someone 
who believed in the truth.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Young 
&amp; Rubicam, which canceled Monday's holiday party, sought to reassure the 
company's 1,000-plus employees 
in a memo.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;While the FBI is fairly certain at this point that this incident is not 
connected to Y&amp;R in any way, we have heightened security in the building and are asking you to 
heighten your awareness during the coming weeks,&quot; it said.
