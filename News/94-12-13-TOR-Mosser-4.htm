</p><p class="body" align="Left">BOMBING PUZZLE 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">ADMAN'S DEATH LINKED TO OTHER ATTACKS 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">NORTH CALDWELL, N.J. (AP) - Thomas Mosser had reached a high point in his 
career - newly promoted to a top job at the giant advertising agency Young and 
Rubicam Inc. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Already he had been involved in a number of high-profile campaigns: Handling 
the news media during the Tylenol poisoning scare, helping promote the 
disastrous new Coke formula and the reintroduction of the classic drink and 
organizing the 1984 cross-country Olympic torch run. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Outside of Madison Avenue, he was probably unknown to anyone but a very close 
reader of the business page. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">LATEST VICTIM 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Somewhere in his list of clients may lie a clue to why the 50-year-old New 
Jersey native was sent a mail bomb that killed him in the kitchen of his 
mansion Saturday in 
a New York City suburb. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI believes Mosser is the latest victim of the man the bureau calls the 
<strong>Unabomber:</strong> Someone who since 1978 has killed two people and injured 23. Investigators 
could not say yesterday exactly why Mosser had been targeted by the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> whose previous targets had connections to universities, airlines or computers. 
 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Investigators were searching for any link between Mosser and the rest of the 
victims. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">FBI CALLED IN 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Young and Rubicam spokesman Richard McGowan said there was no indication the 
bombing was related to Mosser's work, but the FBI said it is reviewing his 
client list. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI said yesterday the bomb had a return address and Dec. 3 postmark from 
San Francisco. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Over the years, Mosser helped Johnson and Johnson handle media inquiries during 
the Tylenol painkiller poisoning cases in 1982. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Seven people died after taking Tylenol capsules laced with cyanide. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mosser also handled Coca-Cola's introduction of its new Coke in the mid-1980s - 
one of the biggest blunders in marketing history - and the launching of 
Coca-Cola Classic. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">He also organized the 1984 cross-country Olympic Torch Run, was hired to help 
South Korea act as 
host of the Olympics and was a member of the New York City Bicentennial 
Committee. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mosser was promoted Dec. 1 to general manager of Young and Rubicam Inc., also 
retaining his executive vice-president title. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mosser's promotion brought him notice in the trade press. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">O.J.'S JUDGE OKAYS PROSECUTOR 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">LOS ANGELES (AP) - The judge in the O.J. Simpson trial refused to remove a 
prosecutor from the case yesterday, rejecting arguments that his work on the 
investigation of a Simpson friend gave him an advantage. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Deputy District Attorney Christopher Darden headed a grand jury investigation 
of Al 
&quot;A.C.&quot; Cowlings, who drove the white Ford Bronco with Simpson inside last summer 
while police followed. The grand jury completed the investigation without 
indicting Cowlings. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Superior Court Judge Lance Ito said 
&quot;there appears to be no 
conflict of interest&quot; stemming from Darden's role in both cases. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The judge only affirmed what I already knew,&quot; said Darden, 
&quot;that I acted appropriately before the grand jury.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">GLASGOW FLOODED 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) - The worst flooding in more than a century forced 645 
people in and around Glasgow to flee their homes. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Three people were believed swept away in rain-swollen rivers. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">About 11 cm of rain fell over the weekend at Glasgow Airport, the most since 
records began in 1888, and rain continued to fall yesterday, the Glasgow 
Weather Centre reported. It said flooding was the worst in at least 106 years. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Two 17-year-old boys were missing after their car was swept off a bridge over 
the swollen River Kelvin, north of 
Glasgow, Strathclyde police said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A search was under way in Dumfries for a 35-year-old man who was believed to 
have fallen into the River Nith. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">WORLD BRIEFS 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">U.S.: RESEARCHER DISCIPLINED FOR VIRUS 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - A Yale researcher who was infected with a dangerous 
virus during a lab accident and then failed to report it was disciplined 
because he put himself and others at risk. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Jean-Paul Gonzalez, a visiting scientist from France, was infected with the 
rodent-borne Sabia arenavirus during an accident Aug. 8 at the Yale Arbovirus 
Research Unit. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Gonzalez became only the third person in the world known to have contracted the 
virus. One of the other two died. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">MEXICO: JAILBIRDS BURROW BELOW JAIL 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">CIUDAD JUAREZ (AP) - Seventeen inmates are still 
at large after they escaped Sunday from a Mexican prison near Texas through an 
elaborate tunnel dug beneath a prison wall. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The men took three to six months to dig a tunnel almost 75 metres long from a 
cell in the CeReSo prison to a nearby orchard, police said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">SWEDEN: FERRY AND BODIES STAY DOWN 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">STOCKHOLM (AP) - A ferry believed to contain more than 800 bodies should not be 
raised from the Baltic Sea, an ethics panel unanimously advised yesterday. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">More than 900 people perished after a storm ripped off the Estonia's front 
cargo door on Sept. 28. Rescuers recovered 94 bodies, and 137 people survived. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">BRAZIL: FORMER PREZ ACQUITTED OF CHARGE 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">BRASILIA (CP) - The Brazilian Supreme Court acquitted former 
president Fernando Collor de Mello of corruption charges yesterday, citing a 
lack of evidence. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The eight-judge panel voted 5-3 to absolve Collor of charges that he funnelled 
millions of dollars for public works projects into bank accounts for his 
personal use. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">AUSTRALIA: MURDER TRIAL FOR WORKER 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">SYDNEY (Reuter) - A court yesterday ordered Sydney roadworker Ivan Milat to 
stand trial for the murder of seven backpackers - five from Europe. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Magistrate Michael Price ordered Milat, 49, to stand trial in the New South 
Wales Supreme Court next year on nine charges following a committal hearing in 
Campbelltown Magistrates Court in Sydney.
