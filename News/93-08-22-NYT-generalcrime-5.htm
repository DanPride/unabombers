So Many Criminals Trip Themselves Up

</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong> 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In North Carolina and New York, two high-visibility crimes provided a chilling 
demonstration last week of how vicious the nation's outlaws can be -- and also 
how foolish. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In one case, the father of basketball star Michael Jordan was shot dead. He was 
picked at random, the police said, by two armed 18-year-olds who were simply 
looking for someone to rob and found him taking a nap on the edge of a highway 
in his expensive car. The other case ended triumphantly as detectives pulled 
Harvey Weinstein, the scrappy 68-year-old owner of a Queens tuxedo factory, 
from the muddy crypt where he had been buried alive for 12 days by kidnappers.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> But what both crimes had in common was the obtuseness of the men accused. It 
was hard to say who was stupider: the suspects in the Jordan murder who made 
repeated calls on their victim's cellular phone, turning his phone bill into a 
trail that led straight to them. Or Fermin Rodriguez, the worker at Mr. 
Weinstein's factory who, police said, picked up $3 million in ransom money and 
drove off in his own car.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;They were trying to be cagey and they became inept,&quot; said Capt. George J. Duke, commander of the New York City Police Major Case 
Squad.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">That criminals would make such foolish basic slipups seems somehow 
counterintuitive in days when the summer's most chilling celluloid villain -- 
John Malkovich of 
&quot;In the Line of Fire&quot; -- comes within a hairbreadth of assassinating the President. He opens false 
bank 
accounts, fashions a plastic gun to slip through metal detectors and builds a 
telephone that outfoxes the Secret Service's best call-tracing technology.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In truth, it is law enforcement that's been given the biggest advantages lately 
by science. Computers that break fingerprints down into mathematical formulas 
and scan thousands an hour for a match have supplanted the old method -- 
comparing smudgy cards by hand. DNA technology can match a bit of blood, hair 
or semen to a suspect with nearly 100 percent certainty.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A few of the richest, most sophisticated drug lords have adapted techniques 
like computer mail to avoid detection, but detectives and prosecutors say that 
much of the country's crime is still spontaneous street violence by ever 
younger and less savvy offenders who don't make much 
effort to hide their tracks.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Most criminals aren't that smart, and when they get caught, they get caught 
because they do something really stupid,&quot; said James A. Fox, dean of the College of Criminal Justice at Northeastern 
University in Boston. 
&quot;In novels and on television we do focus more on the exceptional cases, the ones 
who are able to outsmart the police long enough to make the story dramatic.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Sometimes, painstaking investigative work catches criminals. New York's 
&quot;Son of Sam&quot; killer was found by tracing hundreds of parking tickets given out near the 
sites of his eight shootings; he had blocked a hydrant near one. But every 
detective has a favorite tale of a case solved easily when a suspect did 
something sloppy -- like drop his summons for turnstile-jumping at the scene of 
a subway mugging.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The rate of violent 
crime reached a record high in 1991: 758 for every 100,000 Americans. The rate 
of violent crimes by juveniles, in particular, increased more than 25 percent 
in a decade.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Nonetheless, the ability of the police to solve about 70 percent of homicides 
remained constant over that time. That case-closing rate -- much higher than 
for other crimes like robberies -- is possible because more resources are 
committed to murders and because murder victims often know or are related to 
their killers. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Some experts believe that more crime has, ironically, lulled criminals into 
carelessness.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The volume of crime and the failure of the criminal justice system to control 
it has made criminals less cautious,&quot; said Thomas A. Reppetto, a former Chicago detective who now heads the Citizens 
Crime Commission, a private group that monitors law enforcement 
in New York City.

The Pitfalls of Calling Mom
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Many crimes are committed in the heat of the moment, with no thought to 
erasing fingerprints or witnesses. But one set of criminals that might be 
expected to have wised up are fugitives, most of whom have been caught at least 
once.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The most sophisticated ones, said Keith Braynon, a deputy Federal marshal in 
Florida, change their phones and names and virtually abandon their families to 
escape surveillance.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Most criminals slip up by contacting the family,&quot; he said. 
&quot;Or they will run across a previous associate now cooperating with the 
authorities and will tell them what name they're living under.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Many fugitives have been lured from hiding by ruses that, in retrospect, seem 
laughable. In 1984, Federal marshals in New York City rounded up about 65 
criminals by sending 
letters to their last known addresses telling them they'd won big screen 
televisions or other gifts. When the fugitives called in from hiding to 
collect, they were told to await the truck from the 
&quot;Brooklyn Bridge Delivery Service.&quot; The truck arrived -- with marshals inside.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In Washington, the marshals had even greater success by sending fugitives 
letters say they had won hard-to-get Redskins football tickets and a free 
pre-game brunch. Ninety-six showed up, produced identification and were 
handcuffed.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;In my day, back in the 50's,&quot; Mr. Reppetto said, 
&quot;professional criminals wanted for something serious did not sleep in their beds 
at night, and if you sent them a letter saying they had won a trip to Las 
Vegas, they wouldn't show up.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Chief Inspector Robert Leschorn of the marshals service said: 
&quot;Invariably, greed 
takes over. They always have to have a little more.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">What better proof than the break the F.B.I. got as it was trying to find the 
terrorists responsible for bombing the World Trade Center? They had a crumpled 
piece of a van with a vehicle identification number, and traced it to a Ryder 
rental agency. Who would have thought that Mohammed A. Salameh would return to 
the agency demanding his $400 deposit?
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Other criminals slip up when they believe what they see in movies. The 
kidnappers of Stephen Small in search of a $1 million ransom in Illinois in 
1987 
&quot;were under the belief that to trace a phone call police had to be on the line 
for a period of time,&quot; said Michael A. Ficaro, former head of the criminal division in the Cook 
County States Attorney's office. Not so, he said. 
&quot;When you dial the last digit, the 
phone call is traced.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Still, 350,000 warrants were outstanding last year for fugitives in felony 
cases, and there are criminals who have eluded arrest for years, like the 
mysterious 
&quot;<strong>Unabom&quot;</strong> bomber. In the past 15 years, attacking scientists, he has killed one person 
and injured 22 others with his trademark exploding books, brown paper parcels 
or polished wood boxes, all engraved 
&quot;FC.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">And who knows how many criminals have covered their tracks so well that no one 
knows they have struck. 
&quot;It's hard to say how much crime is really committed,&quot; said Jonathan M. M. Soroko, a private investigator in New York. 
&quot;By definition, if you're really good, your crime's not detected at all.&quot;
