</p><p class="body" align="Left"> A furtive man
with aviator sunglasses and a thin mustache, captured on police videotape at
the scene of a Unabomber attack in Sacramento, is not the UNABOM suspect, federal officials said
yesterday after a flurry of Unabomber activity this week.

After studying the videotape extensively, Sacramento
police said the man they videotaped is about 15 years older than the Unabomber
is believed to be. </a>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
&quot;While it is true that at one time we were attempting to
identify this individual as part of the UNABOM investigation,&quot; said FBI
spokesman George Grotz in San Francisco, &quot;that identification is not a
priority at this time, and we do not believe the individual in that photo to be
the Unabomber.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
The videotaping occurred after the April 24 mail-bomb killing of timber
lobbyist Gilbert Murray in Sacramento. Police noticed a man who suddenly
hurried away when he realized a camera was training on him. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
''This guy caught our attention because he obviously didn't want to be
photographed,'' Sacramento Police Lieutenant Joe Enloe said. ''Was he cutting
work? Cheating on his wife? . . . We don't know.'' 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
When they looked at the tape later on, police saw a man with aviator-style
sunglasses and a thin mustache. Both characteristics bore a resemblance to a
composite sketch of the <strong>Unabomber,</strong> drawn from information
given by a <strong>witness</strong> in Salt Lake City in 1987. She briefly
encountered the <strong>Unabomber</strong> in a parking lot, while he was
planting what turned out to be one of his devices. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
The <strong>Unabomber</strong> has been responsible for three deaths and 23
injuries over the past 17 years. His latest action began June 27, when The
Chronicle received a letter from the <strong>Unabomber,</strong> threatening to
blow up an airliner flying out of Los Angeles International Airport. Federal
aviation and postal officials immediately increased security at all California
airports and within the mail system, tying up air travel and slowing down the
mail. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
The next day, the New York Times got a letter from the <strong>Unabomber,</strong>
saying the threat was ''a prank.'' 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Until June 1993, the <strong>Unabomber's</strong> crimes perplexed everyone
because he had never publicly explained his actions. Since then, he has written
to The Chronicle, the New York Times and the Washington Post, as well as
Penthouse magazine and University of California at Berkeley psychologist Tom
Tyler, in a profusion of letters, accompanied, sometimes, by a 35,000- word
manifesto explaining his political and social philosophy. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Tyler, who was the latest to receive a letter from the <strong>Unabomber,</strong>
sent back a response to the elusive suspect, in the form of a letter that The
Chronicle published on July 4. The professor also gave a copy of the <strong>Unabomber's</strong>
lengthy manifesto to The Chronicle. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Chronicle editors said they are evaluating the manifesto and discussing what further
steps may be appropriate. The <strong>Unabomber</strong> has demanded that the
Times or the Post publish the document, estimated to take up seven full
newspaper pages, by the end of September. Executives of those two papers have
said they are considering their options. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
Meanwhile, federal officials stressed that their hunt for the <strong>Unabomber</strong>
is still focused on the Bay Area and Sacramento. Earlier this week, postal
officials had said the search was moving away from Sacramento and focusing more
on San Francisco and Berkeley. 
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
''We prefer to say the investigation has not specifically focused on any city,
individual or group,'' Grotz said. ''We're still looking at the greater San
Francisco Bay Area. And Sacramento is still viable.''
