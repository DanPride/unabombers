WASHINGTON D.C.  Nunn: Russia turning to nukes 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Russia is turning back to nuclear weapons as the backbone of its military force 
and strategy, Sen. Sam Nunn said Friday.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A top pentagon strategist also said such a change is under way.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Nunn, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, stopped 
short of warning of a renewed Cold War. But he said that the Russian move was 
''a step backwards.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''Their demorilized military and conventional forces having gone down very, 
very substantially, I think they're going to move to rely almost predictably, 
more and more on nuclear weapons,'' Nunn said at a hearing on future U.S.  
military strategy.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Plane bomber gets 10 life terms 

 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A man who killed 110 people with a bomb he planted on a Colombian jetliner was 
sentenced Friday in New York to 10 life prison terms. The Avianca flight blew 
up over Bogota on Nov. 27, 1989.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In 1991, Dandeny Munoz-Mosquera, already in prison on other charges, was 
indicted. He was portrayed as a hired killer for the Medellin cartel, which 
thought rivals and informers were on the plane.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Publisher says bomber called 

 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione said Friday in New York that he won't 
cooperate with the FBI, although he thinks his magazine got a call from a 
bomber who has killed three people since 1978. Guccione hopes to print the 
views of the ''<strong>Unabomber,</strong>'' who demands national publication in exchange for ending his terrorism.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Thirteen refugees picked up by a cruise ship in the Caribbean will be returned 
to Cuba - the first such action under a new U.S. policy, Justice Department 
officials said. The men were adrift about 45 miles south of Little Cayman 
Island on Wednesday.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">About $ 3 million of the legal settlement from the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill 
will be used to pay for 
trails, cabins and other recreational projects, Gov. Tony Knowles said Friday.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Most of the projects will be in the Prince William Sound communities hit 
hardest by the nation's worst oil spill.
