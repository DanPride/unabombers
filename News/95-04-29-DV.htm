</p><p class="body" align="Left">Days before two Unabom attacks in 1993, initials and a slogan now connected to 
the elusive mail-bomb attacker appeared as graffiti on campus buildings at Cal 
State Sacramento, a faculty member says.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The attacks in June 1993 injured university professors in Tiburon and New 
Haven, Conn.  
The FBI was drawn to the Sacramento State campus by the return addresses on the 
packages: Both named faculty members there.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">One of those faculty members, Professor James Hill, said Thursday that just 
before the attacks, the initials FC and the word anarchy had been painted on 
several campus buildings.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Both the initials and the theme of anarchy were included in a leter to The New 
York Times immediately after the 1993 bombing. The initials and the anarchist 
theme were also part of a letter published in the Times this week after the 
latest Unabom attack killed a California timber industry lobbyist in Sacramento 
Monday.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A second letter this week, to Yale University Professor David Gelernter, also 
used the initials FC. Some parts of the bomber's devices have had FC carved on 
them, authorities say.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Agents who swarmed to the campus after the 1993 attacks 
never got a look at the campus graffiti because what was thought to be harmless 
graffiti was quickly washed away.
