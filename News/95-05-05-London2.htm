</p><p class="body" align="Left"> SOME NEWS reports have made the misleading statement that we have been 
attacking universities or scholars. We have nothing against universities or 
scholars as such. We would not want anyone to think that we have any desire to 
hurt professors who study archaeology, history, literature or harmless stuff 
like that. The people we are out to get are the scientists and engineers, 
especially in critical fields like computers and genetics.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The people who are pushing all this growth and progress garbage deserve to be 
severely punished. But our goal is less to punish them than to propagate ideas. 
Anyhow we are getting tired of making bombs. It's no fun having to spend all 
your evenings and weekends preparing dangerous mixures, filing trigger 
mechanisms out of scraps of metal or searching the sierras for a place isolated 
enough to test a bomb. So we offer a bargain.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> We have a long article that we want to have published. If you can get it 
published according to our requirements we will permanently desist from 
terrorist activities. It must be published in the New York Times, Time or 
Newsweek, or in some other widely read, nationally distributed periodical. 
Because of its length we suppose it will have to be serialised.  Alternatively, 
it can be published as a small book.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Please see to it that the answer to our offer is well publicised so that we 
won't miss it. Be sure to tell us where and how it will be published. If the 
answer is satisfactory, we will finish typing the manuscript and send it to 
you. If the answer is unsatisfactory, we will start building our next bomb.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Part of a letter sent to the FBI by the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> reprinted in the New York Times. The 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> so named for the targeting of academics, is thought to be responsible for 15 
bombings over 17 years in the United States.

&quot;A common benign practice in most adults, but a time-consuming, socially 
compromising, or physically harmful condition in some.&quot;

Psychiatry, from .tiff.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Stop worrying 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> I USED to be like everybody else. I showed up to work every day and on time. I 
was a devoted son and husband. Friends came to me with their problems, trusting 
my level-headed instincts to sort out their own Dionysian blunders. To the 
casual observer, I seemed to have it all, I seemed to be well adjusted and 
satisfied with my place in this world. I was even fooling myself.  If someone 
had suggested that I perhaps was not as happy as I seemed to be, I would have 
shaken my head in puzzled amusement.  But something was missing from my life. 
There was an emptiness inside of me. A void that needed filling. I was half a 
man.  But things are different now. My wife has left me. My parents have 
disowned me. Friends snub me.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> You see, my outlook is different now. I'm a new man. A changed man. My whole 
life changed when I met Alek. When I discovered Novahistine DH and learned how 
to stop worrying and love over-the-counter cough syrup.

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> ART critics could become the latest profession to join the burgeoning dole 
queue. Not that art criticism has become yet another victim of new technology. 
It's just that the average 
art critic's job can be done by a pigeon.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> In the current issue of the Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behaviour, 
psychologist Shigeru Watanabe and his colleagues at Keio University in Tokyo 
describe how they trained pigeons to distinguish a Picasso from a Monet, and 
more generally, impressionism from cubism, by pecking the correct picture.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> They trained the pigeons to distinguish between Monet and Picasso with 90 per 
cent accuracy. Once trained, the pigeons maintained their ability even for 
works they had never seen before. And when presented with paintings of other 
impressionists, such as Cezanne and Renoir, the birds lumped these in with 
Monet's portfolio but distinguished them from works by cubists such as Georges 
Braque.

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> InterNAFTA 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> ULTIMATELY, the power of the Internet is that it makes you think like a North 
American. It allows the entire world to 
think and write like North Americans. This is the agenda of the Internet. It 
goes along with NAFTA.

on Global Communications, published in Fringe Ware.

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> I HAVE met some interesting characters in my short time in cyberspace. One 
night, I had a rather serendipitous encounter with an opera singer who went by 
the interesting handle of Modem Butterfly . . . We seemed to be hitting it off 
until she began to withdraw a bit. 
&quot;What's wrong?&quot; I asked. 
&quot;Before this goes any further, I think there's something you should know about 
me,&quot; she said haltingly. 
&quot;I . . . I . . . I only have four megabytes of RAM.  There, I said it,&quot; she confessed.
