</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A federal task force Wednesday announced a $ 1-million reward for help in 
cracking a 15-year string of bombings stretching from coast to coast.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The heads of the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the 
Postal Inspection Service jointly made the unusual appeal after conceding they 
have few clues.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 14 mail bombings, which have been aimed at people involved in airline 
and high-tech industries, as well as academic scientific research since 1978, 
have left one dead and 23 wounded.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Despite years of hard work, federal investigators have no viable suspects 
in these bombings, and that is why the public's help is needed so badly,&quot;<strong>UNABOM</strong> task force officials said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>UNABOM</strong> is an acronym formed from university and bomb.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">At a news conference at FBI headquarters, officials disclosed a new clue in 
the case - a note believed written by the bomber - and predicted there will be 
more bombs.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The words in the note said, 
&quot;Call Nathan R - Wed 7 pm.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;We cannot disclose the source of the notation at this time, but the 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> Task Force has reason to believe that 
&quot;Nathan R'may be associated in 
some fashion with the bomber or bombers,&quot;said FBI Director <a href="http://www.unabombers.com/z19.htm">Louis Freeh</a>. 
&quot;And it may be a completely innocent association.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Freeh would give no information about where or exactly when the note was 
found.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He said 
&quot;Nathan R&quot;may have received a call from the bomber or bombers in 
June, when the two most recent bombs were mailed. Two persons were gravely 
injured in separate incidents when they opened rigged packages.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In June, the New York Times received a letter claiming that a group was 
responsible for the earlier bombings. Investigators believe the letter was 
sent by the person or persons responsible for the bombings.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Four of the bombings have occurred in Illinois and four in California. The 
45-member 
<strong>UNABOM</strong> task force is based in San Francisco and Sacramento, Calif.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Chief Postal Inspector Kenneth Hunter warned Americans to be wary of 
parcels delivered to their home or workplace that are unmarked or the origin 
of which is unknown.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Officials encouraged anyone with knowledge of the case to call this 
toll-free number: 1-800-701-BOMB.
