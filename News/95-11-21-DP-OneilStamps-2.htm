<strong>Unabomber</strong> has smug feeling on outwitting law Who will be his next victim? 



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> Linda Goldston, Knight-Ridder News Service 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">SAN JOSE, Calif. - Somewhere in northern California - in Oakland or San 
Francisco, Berkeley or Sacramento, maybe even San Jose or Silicon Valley - the 
&quot;<strong>Unabomber&quot;</strong> feels pretty proud of himself right now.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He has outsmarted hundreds of the finest U.S. and local investigators.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">They have set up a special task force of 30 agents in San Francisco to work on 
his case full time: agents from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms, top inspectors from the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, homicide 
detectives from California to New Jersey. Fifty more FBI agents have been 
called in to help the task force for two months.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">He has terrorized thousands of people for nearly two decades.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He manipulated the New York Times into publishing his taunts - 
&quot;The FBI is a joke&quot; - and even managed to blast his way back into the headlines in the wake of the 
nation's worst mass killing, the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">FBI behavioral scientists describe him as quiet and patient, likely as finicky 
about his yard as he is about his bomb-making; a man who would drive an older, 
well-kept car rather than choose something flashy; an ideal neighbor who could 
be mixing up explosives in his garage next door and no one would know.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">More important, he is the most dangerous kind of criminal: a man with a 
mission, a killer who will take or maim life to further his cause, a 
self-described anarchist who single-handedly wants to 
stop the technological revolution - and destroy 
&quot;the worldwide industrial system.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He even complained in a letter to the New York Times about 
&quot;having to spend all your evenings and weekends preparing dangerous mixtures 
 or searching the sierras for a place isolated enough to test a bomb.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;A lot of these guys have never distinguished themselves through their careers 
or even their home lives, but they get a tremendous boost to their egos by 
their ability to succeed through killing or bombing,&quot; said James Fox, dean of the College of Criminal Justice at Northeastern 
University in Boston and co-author of 
&quot;Overkill: Mass Murder and Serial Killing Exposed.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Not only by advancing their cause, not only by outsmarting the police but also 
by controlling the lives of thousands of people and ultimately dominating the 
press.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">After 17 years of trying to 
spell out his message obliquely through such symbols as wood and literary 
figures - a message he decided the FBI didn't get - the mysterious 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> apparently has grown tired of merely killing and maiming people. In four 
letters he mailed April 20, the same day as his most recent bomb, he revealed 
more information about himself and his motives than ever.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Suddenly, some of the thousands of clues and tips the Unabomb task force has 
been poring over are starting to make sense. The question is: Can they catch 
him in time?
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The man the FBI dubbed the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> - because his early targets appeared to be universities and airlines - says he 
will stop his reign of terror if the New York Times, Time or Newsweek will 
publish his 29,000- to 37,000-word manifesto. Since he already has killed three 
people and injured 22 others, no one has any doubt he will strike again if they 
don't.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I know a lot about publish or perish here in the academic world, but we never 
meant it to be literal,&quot; said Fox. 
&quot;He's feeling a lot bolder, a lot more invincible. He's saying, 'You can't catch 
me.&quot;'
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bomber even managed to add his trademark twist in what the FBI has called a 
&quot;snide sense of humor.&quot; David Gelernter, a Yale University professor and an expert in computer 
programming and artificial intelligence, has twice been a Unabomb target. 
Gelernter's book on parallel programming reads, 
&quot;Mirror Worlds Or: The Day Software Puts the Universe in a Shoebox.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bomb that killed Gilbert Murray was sent in a shoebox-sized package. 
Murray, who was killed April 24, was president of the California Forestry 
Association, a lobbyist for the timber industry in California.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I 
think it's like a hobby with him, when he gets going on it,&quot; said Chris Ronay, ex-head of the FBI's forensics lab who worked on the case 
for nearly 16 years before retiring to head the Institute of Makers of 
Explosives. 
&quot;I think he enjoys it 
 where he really gets his kicks on this thing. If he's got a job, I think it's 
something he does when he comes home at night and plays with it, like somebody 
would go to the basement and tie flies.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> first started dropping clues in 1978: 10 $ 1 Eugene O'Neill stamps placed on 
his first bomb, a package bomb left in a parking lot at Northwestern University 
in Illinois. On the second, he glued finger-sized short pieces of unfinished 
wood on the outside of a bomb 
left in the commons of the Technology Institute at Northwestern.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">By the time he mailed a book bomb to Percy Wood, then-president of United 
Airlines, he was starting to lay out his battle plan.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Investigators didn't grasp it then, but the man now known as the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> was announcing his one-man war of anarchy against technology and the 
industrialized world.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">They knew he had a fondness for wood; it's the one common theme throughout all 
of his bombings. Wooden boxes, wooden dowels, wooden initiators for the bombs. 
Names or addresses with wood in them, like Percy Wood in Lake Forest. That was 
easy.

<a id="stamps"></a>
Only now, with the help of his own letters, is some of the other symbolism 
starting to make sense. For instance, when he mailed a book bomb to Percy Wood 
in 1980, the bomber enclosed this note: 
&quot;You will find it of great 
social significance.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
<a href="http://www.Unabombers.com/#Stamps">And he used more Eugene O'Neill stamps, first issued in 1967, to mail it, even 
though a different $ 1 stamp had replaced that one the year before. O'Neill, an 
ardent and vocal supporter of anarchists, is our country's only playwright to 
win a Nobel Prize for literature.</a>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> apparently considers literature a worthy category for a Nobel Prize, unlike 
biotechnology, which helped two Massachusetts scientists win the 1993 Nobel 
Prize for Medicine. In letters to them last month, he ordered them to 
stop their work or risk his wrath.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Home for the bomber is northern California. He could be almost anyone, his 
bombs enclosed in almost anything. They arrive in such innocent-looking 
packages.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In his letter last month to the Times, he said he wanted to set the record 
straight.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Some news reports have made the misleading statement that we have been 
attacking universities or scholars,&quot; the bomber wrote. 
&quot;We would not want anyone to think that we have any desire to hurt professors 
who study archaeology, history, literature or harmless stuff like that.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The people we are out to get are the scientists and the engineers.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">When he first started killing, it was hard to tell who he was after.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Detective Bob Bell had been assigned to the homicide unit of the Sacramento 
County Sheriff's Department for less than a year when he was sent to Rentech 
Computer Rental on Dec. 11, 1985. The body already had been removed, but Bell 
could tell driving 
up this was 
&quot;a new kind of murder scene.&quot; Like most homicide detectives, he was used to a confined murder scene, inside 
an apartment or a house, on a street corner or even in a field.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Here, most of the evidence was projected away from the victim, and a 20-mph 
wind had further strewn what bomb fragments were left. Bell's supervisor, Lt. 
Ray Biondi, shared what little information he had. Together, they later would 
fill 17 loose-leaf binders with tips and clues, ruminations and projections.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Hugh Campbell Scrutton, 38, owner of the computer store, had been on his way to 
an appointment around noon when he stepped out the back door and saw a crumpled 
brown paper bag on the ground in front of him.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">It was an ordinary grocery bag, just big enough to hold a half-gallon of 
milk, a loaf of bread and a dozen eggs. A dumpster was immediately to his left, 
and Scrutton bent down to pick up the bag, probably to throw it away.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">When he did, a pipe bomb hidden inside exploded into his chest, carving a 
gaping path. Most of his right hand, tiny pieces of tissue and bone, was 
embedded in a nearby wall.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Scientists in the high-tech world can't help but wonder who will be next. And 
everyone from computer hackers to computer executives has wondered why the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> has not struck in Silicon Valley, birthplace of the personal computer.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;It's a reasonable question,&quot; said FBI Special Agent Rick Smith, spokesman for the task force.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Nobody knows.&quot;
