A Task Force Comes Alive Once More 



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> 
By JOHN MARKOFF 



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>DATELINE:</strong> SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 12 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">When the bomber struck twice, within days, last year, the agents and detectives 
and inspectors were summoned together with great urgency in a task force called 
<strong>Unabom.</strong> But as the days dragged on and the leads ran dry, just as they had repeatedly 
over the years, some investigators who once spent full time pursuing leads in 
the case were reassigned, one after another, to other cases.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Until Saturday, when the bomber struck again.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The agents were rapidly reassembled to resume their frustrating pursuit -- a 
chase made all the harder, investigators say, by the feeling that they are so 
physically close to their target as he remains tantalizingly out of reach.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> After the twin bomb attack of June 1993, the task force was formed and grew to 
more than 45 full-time investigators. But more recently the number had been 
scaled back to 25 or 30. Today, Jim R. Freeman, the special agent in charge of 
the San Francisco office of the F.B.I., where the investigators are working, 
said the task force was being rebuilt, although he would not say to what size.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> This search has taken on a personal flavor for members of the special task 
force, assembled from three Government agencies -- the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the Postal 
Service.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> They are pursuing an attacker they have never seen, yet they act and 
talk as if he is out there watching them.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> At a news conference, Mr. Freeman, who heads the task force, was pressed for 
details about the investigation. 
&quot;I'm not only speaking to you in the press and to the general public, but to the 
<strong>Unabom</strong> suspect as well.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> At the news conference convened after the bomber struck last weekend for the 
15th time, killing Thomas J. Mosser, an advertising agency executive in North 
Caldwell, N.J., Mr. Freeman said there was little more concrete to go on other 
than a brief glimpse a woman caught of the bomber seven years ago and postmarks 
on the packages sent to victims.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Attempting to find patterns in that brief sighting and the shards of evidence 
collected from blast sites, the task force, which is based in the Federal 
Building here, has been using computers extensively to seek patterns 
in the vast array of clues they have compiled, but without success. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
&quot;This investigation is very complex,&quot; Mr. Freeman said. 
&quot;We have been using computer support to pull together millions of bits of 
information.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
&quot;When everything comes together, it will seem so obvious,&quot; said one former member of the Government task force. 
&quot;It will be like a jigsaw puzzle.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Mr. Freeman noted several times today that many of the threads in the 
investigation lead back to northern California. The bomber has attacked people 
in the San Francisco Bay area and in Sacramento, and 7 of the 15 bombings in 
the case can be identified as having a link to the region.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> He also said investigators believed that the bomber had been on the move 
during the last 16 years. He has possibly lived in Illinois, Salt Lake City, 
Sacramento and the Bay area at different times.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Today, 
Mr. Freeman appealed to the public to come forward with useful leads in the 
case. Next to his lectern was a photo blowup of one intriguing hint -- an 
impression of a writing sample lifted from a letter sent to The New York Times 
after two bombing attacks last year. In clear handwriting it says, 
&quot;Call Nathan R Wed 7 pm.&quot; Nathan R., if he knows the bombing suspect, has never come forward.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Mr. Freeman was not willing to talk about some of the likely blind alleys that 
investigators have gone down. For a while during the 1980's they followed a 
hint that the bomber was a technician who worked in making prosthetic devices, 
law-enforcement officials have said. That clue came from the packaging material 
used in some of the devices.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> He also declined to comment 
on what the political outlook of the bomber might be. The letter to The Times, 
sent last June, said the bombs were the work of an anarchist group called FC.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> The initials FC have been found in many of the bombs, but today Mr. Freeman 
said F.B.I. experts had not yet found the initials in the bomb that killed Mr. 
Mosser.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The case has been a personal one for Detective Bob Bell, a Sacramento police 
detective who has been gathering material on the case for almost a decade.
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
&quot;There's a sense of frustration here,&quot; he said. 
&quot;For myself it's very frustrating that this person lives not to far from me. 
It's not like he's beyond my reach.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 
&quot;There are a thousand theories,&quot; he added. 
&quot;They all make sense.&quot;
