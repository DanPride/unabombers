</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> By JOE HEANEY 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The crazed killer known as 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> has murdered three victims and injured at least 23 - sending 16 mail bombs in 
a 17-year reign of terror that has baffled a federal task force.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Federal investigators say they have never seen a bomber like him and concede he 
could strike again at any time.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;We don't know what his motivation is. We don't know what his demands are. It's 
so damned difficult,&quot; says Rick Smith of the San Francisco FBI office.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Two years of intense investigation by two dozen agents from the FBI, Treasury 
Department and the U.S. Postal Service have yielded few solid leads.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> is believed to be a white male, in his 40s, quiet, anti-social and very 
meticulous. Instead of buying electrical switches for his explosives he makes 
them himself.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The bombs have increased in sophistication,&quot; said Smith. 
&quot;Today he's more able to do certain things than 17 years ago.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The targets have changed over the years. First they were universities and 
professors, particularly engineering. Then aviation, with an American Airlines 
flight almost blown up in 1979. Then computer stores. In 1993, it was back to 
professors.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> they believe, once lived in Chicago, has frequented Salt Lake City and 
probably moved to the San Francisco area.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">There are too many suspects - about 3,000 since the probe began.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">California 
timber industry lobbyist Gilbert B. Murray was the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> third and latest fatal victim, killed two weeks ago when he opened a heavy 
shoebox-type package delivered to his Sacramento office near the state capitol.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Federal investigators have also tied the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> to mail explosives that killed a Sacramento computer store rental clerk in 
1987 and a New Jersey advertising executive in 1994.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Murray, who was in his late 40s, was a lobbyist for the California Forestry 
Association. The package was not addressed to him, but the FBI declined to 
identify the intended recipient.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Besides two Massachusetts scientists, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> also sent a mocking letter last month to a previous victim, Yale computer 
scientist David Gelernter.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In that letter he ridiculed Gelernter for opening a package bomb that injured 
him in 1993.
