</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A New Jersey advertising executive is the latest victim of a bomber blamed for 
another death and 23 injuries since 1978, FBI officials said Sunday.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Thomas Mosser, 50, died after opening a video-size package addressed to him at 
home in North Caldwell, N.J., the FBI's Barry Mawn said.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mawn said agents don't know why Mosser was targeted, but agents believe his 
death is linked to 15 other mail bombs sent to individuals, companies and 
colleges in the USA.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The components of the bomb, its construction, make us believe the bombs are 
linked,&quot; said Mawn.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He said it was 
&quot;extremely powerful.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Saturday, the package exploded in Mosser's hand and blew a large hole in a 
counter, filling the house with smoke.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mosser's wife, Susan, who received the package Friday, described it as small, 
neatly wrapped and white.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mawn did not know where the package originated.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Officials call their investigation 
<strong>Unabom</strong> because an earlier incident was at a university and one was on an airliner.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Progress is essential because there is great concern the bomber or bombers will 
strike again,&quot; said FBI agent Jim Freeman.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Richard McGowan, of 
Young 
&amp; Rubicam Inc., where Mosser had recently been named executive vice president, 
said, 
&quot;We are stunned by this senseless loss.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Officials are offering a $ 1 million reward in the case. To reach the task 
force, call: 1-800-701-BOMB (2662).<p class="body" align="Left">&nbsp;<strong>GRAPHIC:</strong> PHOTO, color, Linda Radin
