</p><p class="body" align="Left">Chicago universities Monday alerted faculty members, students and employees 
after a mail bomb, traced to a bomber who previously made four attacks in the 
Chicago area, killed a New Jersey advertising executive over the weekend.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Chicago-based agents from the FBI, Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Bureau and 
Postal Inspection Service who are members of a national task force 
investigating the bomber were also on alert.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bomb apparently was made by a serial bomber, code-named 
<strong>Unabom,</strong> who began his bombings in Chicago in 1978 and then expanded nationwide.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Saturday's death brought the bomber's toll to two dead and 22 injured in 15 
attacks.  The bomber originally targeted university personnel, computer 
businesses or aircraft companies.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Northwestern University spokesman Chuck Loebbaka said, 
&quot;We are issuing an advisory to use caution in opening packages that seem out of 
the ordinary. This will be faxed to all departments and residences.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Similar precautions, including computer mail messages and printed notices, were 
used to warn staff at the University of Chicago, University of 
Illinois-Chicago, DePaul University and Loyola University.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Jerry Singer, an ATF spokesman, said there has been speculation the bomber may 
once have lived in the Chicago area.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The first bombing was on May 25, 1978, when a stamped package, addresssed to a 
Troy, N.Y., professor from a Northwestern instructor, was found by a woman in 
a parking lot at Taylor and Morgan near the UIC engineering school.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">She gave it to Chicago police, who took it to the Northwestern professor. When 
he said he did not know anything about the package, a Northwestern security 
guard opened the package in the Technological Institute building, and it 
exploded, injuring him.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">On May 9, 1979, a Northwestern graduate student opened a cigar box-size 
container, once again at Northwestern's Technological Institute, and it 
exploded, injuring the student.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Twelve people suffered smoke inhalation on May 15, 1979, when a bomb exploded 
in the cargo hold of an American Airlines Boeing 727 during a flight from 
Chicago to Washington. Former United Airlines President Percy Wood was injured 
at his Lake Forest home on June 
10, 1980, when he opened a package.<p class="body" align="Left">&nbsp;<strong>GRAPHIC:</strong> See also related story.
