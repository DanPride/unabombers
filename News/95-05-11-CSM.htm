</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The US Federal authorities filed bombing charges against Terry Nichols, who is 
currently being held in Kansas as a material witness in the Oklahoma City case, 
the Los Angeles Times and the New York Times reported. Nichols was scheduled 
for an initial hearing yesterday in Wichita, Kan. The FBI, meanwhile, said it 
is investigating whether Nichols's 12-year-old son could be the person depicted 
in the ''John Doe 2'' sketches. Authorities said the son is not believed to be 
a suspect in the bombing but may have been with Timothy McVeigh when McVeigh 
rented a truck allegedly used to carry the bomb to Oklahoma City. (Story, Page 
4.)
</p><p class="body" align="Left">House Budget Committee chairman John Kasich released details of his proposed 
budget, saying he would lower the deficit to $ 152 billion in fiscal year 
1996 and to zero by 2002. Kasich was to formally present his budget yesterday. 
He said his proposal would include $ 1.4 trillion in cuts over seven years, 
more than the Senate proposal released earlier, which would cut $ 961 billion 
over the same period. The Senate Budget Committee's budget also carves savings 
out of Medicare and Medicaid and eliminates the Department of Commerce and more 
than 100 other programs.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The administration criticized GOP legislation that would cut aid spending and 
dismantle the government's foreign-aid agency. The Republican proposal would 
cut $ 2.8 billion from the $ 18.4 billion President Clinton has requested for 
foreign operations.
 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The administration said its farm-bill proposals would protect family farmers 
against budget cutting by congressional Republicans. The proposals would keep 
core farm programs intact while denying payments to farm owners who make more 
than $ 100,000 a year off the farm. The plan also called for changes in the 
food-stamp program to give states more control, while cutting back on fraud and 
errors. (Iowa welfare reform, Page 1.)

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Senate adopted a proposal limiting punitive damages in product-liability 
cases, but only after scaling it back to allow judges to override the limits. 
(Story, Page 3.)

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A bill to overhaul the nation's banking system by letting commercial banks 
combine with Wall Street firms won House Banking Committee approval. The 
committee did 
not address the toughest issue threatening the measure: whether banks should be 
allowed to expand into the insurance business. (Story, Page 9.)

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Most top private economist think the US can avoid a damaging recession through 
1996, according to a survey by Eggert's Blue Chip Economic Indicators. The 
economists also expect the dollar to regain some ground over the next few 
years, the survey showed. (Story, Page 1.)

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Interior Secretary Babbitt joined environmentalists in denouncing proposed 
legislation that would weaken the Endangered Species Act. Under the proposal, 
once a species is identified as endangered, the secretaries of interior and 
commerce would decide whether to save it from extinction. Currently, the 
government must protect any species listed as endangered.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A federal commission expanded the list of US military bases that may be closed 
this year. Bases in Georgia, 
Utah, Oklahoma, Texas, and California were added to Pentagon's list.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI confirmed that Richard J. Roberts, co-winner of the 1993 Nobel Prize 
for medicine, received one of four letters sent by the ''<strong>Unabomber'</strong>' April 20, the same day he mailed a bomb that killed a Sacramento timber 
lobbyist.



</p><p class="body" align="Left">The World
</p><p class="body" align="Left">No major Russian concessions came out of the Moscow summit, but US President 
Clinton won partial deals from President Yeltsin, who said his country would 
join NATO's Partnership for Peace and would not sell gas centrifuge equipment 
to Iran. Four hours of talks left stark differences on Russia's repression in 
Chechnya, Moscow's sale of two nuclear reactors to Iran, and the ultimate scope 
of NATO, which wants to include Poland and other former Soviet-bloc nations in 
a 
reach eastward. Yeltsin also agreed to delay the sale of the reactors to Iran 
to allow a review by a commission led by US Vice President Gore. (Stories, 
Pages 1 and 6.)

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Northern Ireland's peace talks were edged up a notch as Michael Ancram, 
Britain's second- ranking minister in the province, sat down in Belgrade with 
Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness to talk about disarming the IRA and cutting 
British forces there. Until now, Britain would allow only civil servants to 
take part in the talks. Sinn Fein is the political arm of the IRA.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Imelda Marcos was on her way to winning a House seat in Philippine elections, 
but her son, Ferdinand ''Bongbong,'' was trailing in his race for a Senate 
seat, ending for now hopes of a Marcos-family 
comeback. President Ramos's coalition was leading in 10 of 12 contested Senate 
seats and 183 of 204 house seats. Ramos said he will proceed with economic and 
social reforms. (Story, Page 6.)

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Serbs closed their key corridor running across northern Bosnia after Croat 
forces from Bosnia and Croatia launched an offensive against the corridor 
yesterday. The supply corridor links Serb-held land in eastern Bosnia with 
western Bosnia, as well as Serb-controlled land in Croatia. Serbs also 
tightened their hold on Sarajevo. UN chief Akashi said prospects were ''dark'' 
in the besieged city, while the US renewed calls for NATO airstrikes on Serbs 
for shelling Sarajevo and other ''safe areas.'' (Editorial, Page 20.)

</p><p class="body" align="Left">French President-elect Chirac will take quick 
action on unemployment, a spokesman for the conservative Paris mayor said. 
Chirac, whose victory Sunday caused a stock-market rally on Tuesday, has been 
meeting with key ministerial candidates. Outgoing Socialist President Mitterand 
is expected to hand over power around May 17.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">South Korean Prime Minister Lee Hong Koo met in Beijing with Chinese Premier Li 
Pen to discuss strengthening economic ties and keeping peace on the Korean 
Peninsula. Lee's visit is the first by a South Korean prime minister since the 
two nations established diplomatic relations in 1992. South Korea also wants 
support for its effort to steer North Korea away from any nuclear-weapons 
program.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The US's chief negotiator with North Korea, Robert Gallucci, met in Seoul with 
South 
Korean and Japanese allies to talk strategy on suspended nuclear negotiations 
with North Korea. The US has rejected a North Korean proposal to restart the 
talks in Pyongyang.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Three hundred Hutus finally left the Kibeho camp in southwest Rwanda, the last 
of the tens of thousands of Hutus who had been living in its squalor. Soldiers 
of the Tutsi-led government killed up to 2,000 of the refugees three weeks ago 
in an effort to shut the camp.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A trial began in Germany of three people accused of smuggling bomb-grade 
plutonium. The lawyer for the three men -- two from Spain and one from Columbia 
-- argued that they were set up by German intelligence agents. This claim 
echoes another one made by Chancellor Kohl's political opponents after the 
August 1994 bust at Munich airport, charging 
it was set up to help Kohl get reelected.


</p><p class="body" align="Left">Etcetera
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Parents should have access to a ''report card'' rating violence on TV, say two 
senators who are concerned about broadcasting's effect on children. Senators 
Dorgan and Hutchison introduced legislation that would provide TV-violence 
ratings on a quarterly basis. The ratings would be compiled by a nonprofit 
group, such as a university, with US grants.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mike Shuter looks to the skies as he plants seeds in the ground. The Madison 
County, Ind., corn grower is among about 500 US farmers who use satellites to 
help with spring planting.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">There's a new link between Russia and the US: golf. An American company is 
combining melted-down scrap from old US and Soviet missiles to make golf clubs. 
The California-based Peace Missile Corp. 
says part of the proceeds goes to charities in both countries.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A group of business and public officials is trying to reeducate New Yorkers, at 
least the ones tourists meet, to lure more visitors to the Big Apple. If New 
Yorkers were nicer, the group estimates, tourists would spend $ 50 million atop 
the $ 20 billion they already spend in the city each year.
