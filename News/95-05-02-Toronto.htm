&quot;disturbing&quot; nuclear deal with Tehran. It set the stage for conflict at next week's Moscow 
summit between Yeltsin and U.S. President Bill Clinton. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">White House aides said the stiffened sanctions against Iran will mostly hurt

</p><p class="body" align="Left">NEW YORK (AP) - An 85-year-old priest was mugged in the confessional by a man 
who begged him for some money and asked to make a confession, police said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Rev. Raymond Dendon gave some change to the man, who then asked the priest to 
hear his 
confession. Inside the confessional, the man grabbed the priest's arm through

car),&quot; Maj. Robbie Cooke said.

<strong>Unabomber's</strong> manifesto and put his public relations team behind the effort 
&quot;in order to save lives.&quot;

29,000-word manifesto.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - Prosecutors agreed yesterday to drop charges against the 
daughter of Malcolm X in a plot to murder Nation of Islam leader Louis 
Farrakhan. Qubilah Shabazz, 34, who saw her father murdered 30 years ago, 
agreed to abandon allegations of an FBI frame-up and seek treatment for alcohol 
and psychiatric problems. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Prosecutors agreed to drop the charges after two years if Shabazz completes 
treatment and stays out of legal trouble. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">If convicted, she faced up to 90 years in prison and a $ 2.25 million fine.
