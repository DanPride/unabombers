From a Child of Promise to the Unabom Suspect 



</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> 
By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">It was just a dusty, cobwebbed cabin high in the Rockies, as remote as a 
cougar's lair. But it suited a man who had always been alone, this genius with 
gifts for solitude, perseverance, secrecy and meticulousness, for penetrating 
the mysteries of mathematics and the dangers of technology, but never love, 
never friendship.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The furnishings were the fragments of his life: the books for companionship and 
the bunk for the lonely hours, the wood stove where night after night he 
watched dying embers flicker visions of a wretched humanity, the typewriter 
where, the authorities say, the justifications for murder had been crafted like 
numbered theorems.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Theodore John Kaczynski had been a brilliant mathematician at the University of 
California at Berkeley long ago, when he was only 25. But after teaching two 
years and publishing papers that dazzled his peers and put him on a tenure 
track at one of the nation's most prestigious universities, he quit in a 
tailspin of disillusionment with mathematics -- the sole passion of his life, 
suddenly dead.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Over the years since -- nearly half his life -- he found a kind of freedom as a 
backwoods hermit in Montana. The miseries of his boyhood in suburban Chicago, 
his humiliating undergraduate days at Harvard University, the bitterness of 
years wasted on graduate studies at the University of Michigan, the images of 
antiwar turmoil at Ann Arbor and Berkeley, had all dimmed with the passing 
seasons as the face grew old and the beard gray, as obstinate lines formed at 
the corners of the silent mouth.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Slowly, too, the instabilities he had taken into the woods -- the inability to 
cope with people, the misreading of intentions, the obsessions and rigidities, 
the anger lurking behind the calm eyes -- deteriorated at last, leaving someone 
even his family did not 
recognize on the rare occasions they saw him, or in the hundreds of letters 
that finally stopped.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I think that truth from my point of view is that Ted has been a disturbed 
person for a long time and he's gotten more disturbed,&quot; David Kaczynski, the only brother of the man arrested last month in the Unabom 
investigation, said in a six-hour interview with The New York Times. It was 
David, the person closest to the suspect, who turned him in.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">David recalled the terrible day last October when he first read the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> manifesto, a killer's scholarly vision of humanity enslaved in a nightmare 
world of technology, and found the echoes of his brother's letters and his 
essays on science, politics and sociology.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;It was horrible to me that I would be considering my brother to be this person,&quot; he said. But it was all too possible, he knew, that his brilliant and 
difficult 
older sibling, whose increasingly troubled and angry life had hurt and 
mystified his family for decades, might be the phantom who had already killed 3 
people and maimed 23 in 18 years.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Throughout an afternoon tinged with regret, David Kaczynski, a gentle 
46-year-old social worker and vegetarian, a former teacher and an outdoorsman 
who had lived for months in a tent, seemed out of place in a Manhattan hotel 
suite where he spoke.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But he maintained his composure until near the end. Then, as dusk sailed the 
Hudson and failing sunlight struck the walls with shafts the color of whiskey, 
his soft voice quavered and tears brimmed in his eyes as he spoke of his 
family's anguish and of his love for his fallen idol.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I think I love his purity,&quot; David said. 
&quot;I think he's a person 
who wanted to love something and unfortunately, again, it gets so complex. He 
failed to love it in the right way because in some deep way, he felt a lack of 
love and respect himself.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Six weeks after Theodore Kaczynski's arrest at the cabin, where, the 
authorities say, the manifesto's master copy and the typewriter used to create 
it were found with a mountain of evidence, the suspect has remained as silent 
in his cell in Helena, Mont., as he had been in his 25-year, self-imposed exile.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But conversations with people who have known him, and the interview with the 
brother who has been the most intimate observer of a secretive man, have 
provided a detailed and sweeping portrait of the 54-year-old suspect and his 
personality, mental problems and tortured relationships.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">People who had known Ted as a boy, as a high school and college student, as 
a professor at Berkeley and as a recluse in Montana, as well as investigators 
and 
<strong>witnesses</strong> in the Unabom case, have drawn a picture of a man whose life seemed destined 
to be torn apart -- a mathematical genius who rose swiftly to academic heights 
even as he became an emotional cripple.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">It is a funereal portrait of loneliness, obsession and contradictions -- a 
Harvard degree at 20, but no one to call a friend; rising success in one of the 
nation's top mathematics departments, then total retreat from society; a 
concern for humanity and nature that led finally, officials say, to a one-man 
war against technology, and the cold calculation of the death of strangers.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Outside his family, Ted seems never to have had a real friend after boyhood. 
The closest thing to a relationship, perhaps, was 
a seven-year correspondence with a man in Mexico whom he never met; he revealed 
little of himself, and rebuffed his correspondent's overtures to meet or draw 
him out. 
&quot;If you want to be my friend,&quot; he wrote bluntly, 
&quot;don't give me advice.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Lengthy searches in Illinois, Michigan, Massachusetts, Iowa, California, Utah 
and Montana, where he is known to have lived or visited in the last four 
decades, uncovered no one after his boyhood who had been anything but a casual 
acquaintance.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">And aside from his mother, who doted on him as a boy, there appears to have 
been no substantive relationship with a woman in all his life. He dated a girl 
once or twice after high school graduation, but he ended it with a refusal to 
brook her Catholic precepts. His last date -- with a Chicago-area woman who 
rebuffed him -- took place 18 years 
ago, just after the first Unabom explosion.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;What amazes me the most about it is that somehow -- if he in fact did kill and 
maim people -- he had put a wall around that part of himself and hide it away 
or keep it inside,&quot; David said. 
&quot;I think his ability to have a conscience, to have sympathy for people, created 
for him a people problem he could not solve except by walling those feelings.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">As Ted built his walls of physical and psychological separation, David and 
others said, he cut himself off from a society in turmoil, from parents who he 
said cared more about his brain than his happiness, and from a brother who, by 
marrying, came to represent a kind of betrayal.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">And as the years of backwoods solitude passed and his contacts with the world 
withered, his life came to be expressed in the written words he had always used 
as weapons -- hundreds of 
letters to his family, to his Mexican acquaintance, and to newspapers and 
magazines; then rambling tracts on society, and finally, the authorities say, 
the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> manifesto.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">David and his parents had long worried over Ted's anger and wondered at its 
origins. And David recounted stories -- how Ted at 9 months had been 
hospitalized and denied almost all contact with his parents, and how Ted at 7 
years had been left alone to sob in a hospital lobby while his father and 
grandmother went to the maternity ward where David had been born.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He told how the family had come to believe there was something deeply wrong 
between Ted and his parents, Theodore R. and Wanda Kaczynski. 
&quot;I always had a sense that something was missing,&quot; he said. 
&quot;The bond was never complete there, the way it had been with me.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">As the years passed and the adolescent Ted became a friendless intellectual 
pariah, there were softball games in which David and boys his 
age were joined by his brother, who felt comfortable among children five, six 
and seven years younger. David recalled a brother who found it painful to err, 
who berated others for minor lapses, who shut himself up in his bedroom for 
days at a time, and who seemed incapable of sympathy, insight or simple 
connection with people.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In adulthood, David remembered an overbearing brother who could return his 
letter with grammatical corrections; who could turn a conversation about 
David's term paper into a humiliating demolition of his ideas on Freudian 
analysis; who could cut himself off from a dying father who had always been 
generous; who could harass a woman for rebuffing his advances, and who could 
react to the news of David's engagement with a denunciation of his fiancee -- 
a woman he had never met -- as manipulative, and of David for virtual betrayal.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">There were times, David said, when in an effort to help, he dared ask Ted about 
his sense of injury. It only made his brother angrier, and he backed off. Now 
he seems haunted by the possibility that he somehow failed to understand or to 
find the magic words of comfort.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I think back,&quot; he said, 
&quot;and I think I missed a lot of opportunities to be of help.&quot; He even expressed regret over the times when he said he allowed himself to be 
angry with his brother's imperious put-downs and dark moods. Indeed, he 
recalled the privilege he felt when, as a boy, he was permitted into the 
privacy of his brother's room.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He remembered small acts of kindness, too: how Ted once nailed a spool to the 
bottom of a screen door so that David, a toddler too small to reach the handle, 
could go 
in and out; how Ted later imparted his knowledge of woodsmanship and plant 
life, and how Ted only a few years ago sent him a picture of a child in a 
baseball cap with a note flecked with nostalgia. It said, 
&quot;This picture reminded me of you and what kind of child you were.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I had the sense,&quot; David said, 
&quot;that he wanted me to be the little brother.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Most vividly, David recalled with a catch in his voice the tale of a moment -- 
nearly a decade ago -- when he came closest to his brother emotionally. In any 
other family, the moment might have been routine. He was visiting Ted's Montana 
cabin, he said, and was sawing wood when the work table collapsed under him, 
and he and the saw went down.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Ted ran over, asking 
&quot;Are you O.K?&quot; David said he was worried about the saw, one of Ted's few tools. 
&quot; 'The hell with the saw. Are you O.K?' 
&quot; he 
quoted Ted as saying. 
&quot;He touched my shoulders,&quot; he said, still amazed at the memory. 
&quot;It was incredible and touching and human.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">On the same visit in 1986, Ted, playing the tutor, had David in the role of 
pupil read from a Spanish book. 
&quot;It wasn't a role that I at the time relished,&quot; David said. But he said he went along with it for his brother's sake. 
&quot;I love my brother, and he seemed to really just kind of enjoy it.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But Ted had always set the terms of their relationship, and it sometimes hurt. 
&quot;The issue of being able to control how much he let a person in, and for how 
long -- it was important to him,&quot; David recalled. In that sense, the very remoteness of the cabin was as much a 
means of controlling the access of others as it was a symbol of freedom.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A few 
years ago, Ted said he would not open letters from David unless the stamp was 
underlined as a signal of a family emergency or some other significant news. So 
when their father was dying of lung cancer, David made sure the letter to Ted 
was marked in that way. 
&quot;Ted wrote back, and the response was fairly peculiar -- basically, that I had 
done well, that this was something worth communicating.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">David explained, with evident pain, why he had felt obliged to 
<strong>identify</strong> his brother as the prime suspect in a case that had bedeviled law-enforcement 
authorities since the beginning, generating the longest, most extensive Federal 
manhunt in the nation's history, and why he was speaking out now.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;If he did attack people and kill people, that was wrong,&quot; David said. 
&quot;But by the same token, I feel it would be very wrong if he was killed in the 
name of some notion or principle of justice. I 
think it's important that people see him as a human being.&quot; He added, 
&quot;It serves no one's interest to put him to death, and certainly it would be an 
incredible anguish for our family if that were to happen.&quot;

The Child

Having Trouble Fitting In 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Kaczynski forebears were Polish Catholics, solid working-class men and 
women, and they arrived in America early in the 20th century with their frayed 
immigrant suitcases and their New World hope.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Ted Kaczynski's paternal grandparents, Jacob and Helen Kaczynski, after a 
sojourn in Pittsburgh, were drawn to Chicago because other Kaczynskis had 
preceded them and were prospering in the manufacture of sausages. Theodore 
Richard Kaczynski, born in 1912, and his brothers Stanley and Alex, all went to 
work at Kaczynski's Sausages, a factory owned by an uncle, on the fringe of the 
stockyards on Chicago's South Side.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Wanda 
Dombek was born of Polish immigrant parents, John and Mary Dombek, in 
Zanesville, Ohio, in 1917. But her family, too, moved to Chicago. There in the 
1930's, she met young Theodore. They were married on April 11, 1939, and moved 
into a rented house on South Wolcott, a blue-collar Polish enclave of neat 
homes and tiny well-tended yards close to Kaczynski's Sausages.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Theodore R. Kaczynski was gregarious and an outdoorsman who loved to go 
hunting, fishing and camping. As teen-agers, he and his wife had dropped out of 
high school to work, but had earned night school diplomas. They were both 
readers who valued education and liked to talk about politics. By all accounts, 
Mr. Kaczynski was also hard-working, thoughtful and kind.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Wanda Kaczynski was especially well-read and articulate, familiar with science 
and the 
works of Shakespeare, Austen, Dickens, Thackeray and other authors whose books 
crowded her shelves. The Kaczynskis also shared progressive social and 
political views, were active in Democratic clubs and wrote letters to 
newspapers in defense of liberal programs. Though they were raised as 
Catholics, they became atheists.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the early 1940's, the couple moved to Carpenter Street, two blocks from 
where the Chicago Circle campus of the University of Illinois would be built. 
It was a bigger house in a better area. Their first son, Theodore John, was 
born there on May 22, 1942. They called him 
&quot;Teddy&quot; and doted on him.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But when he was only 9 months old, an unusual medical problem arose. David, who 
had been told the story by his parents, said the infant Teddy developed a 
severe allergy and was hospitalized for a week. 
&quot;There were rigid regulations about when parents could and 
couldn't visit,&quot; David said. He recalled that on two occasions, his parents 
&quot;were allowed to visit him for one hour.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">After Teddy came home, 
&quot;he became very unresponsive,&quot; David said. 
&quot;He had been a smiling, happy, jovial kind of baby beforehand, and when he 
returned from the hospital, he showed little emotions for months.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Wanda kept a diary about her boy and read to him daily from children's books, 
then from classic boys' literature and later from surprisingly advanced 
materials. A neighbor said Teddy was in grade school when Wanda began reading 
him articles from Scientific American that a college student might find 
challenging. But with her help, he seemed to grasp concepts with ease.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">While bookish, Teddy was remembered by an aunt as affectionate. But the aunt, 
who asked to remain anonymous, said she saw a change after David was born on 
Oct. 3, 1949. Teddy was 7 then, and the aunt said he seemed crestfallen at 
having to share the attention his parents had lavished upon him.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Before David was born, Teddy was different,&quot; the aunt said. 
&quot;When they'd visit, he'd snuggle up to me. Then, when David was born, something 
must have happened. He changed immediately. Maybe we paid too much attention to 
the new baby.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">David said his parents told him about how his father, grandmother and Teddy had 
gone to the hospital after his birth. But children were not allowed in the 
maternity ward. 
&quot;So my father and grandmother left Ted in the lobby and went up to visit me,&quot; he said. 
&quot;When they all went down to the lobby -- I guess I was coming home -- he was 
sitting there alone in tears and very deeply upset.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Neighbors said there were no signs that the Kaczynskis favored David over 
Teddy. One remembered loving parents 
who were 
&quot;exceptionally interested&quot; in both children. David said his mother told him that she gradually encouraged 
Ted to hold him, and that 
&quot;from that time forward, he showed a great deal of gentleness toward me.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">By 1952, the Kaczynskis had saved enough money to leave the crowded city, and 
they bought a three-bedroom, brick Cape Cod home in Evergreen Park, a 
middle-class South Side suburb of tradesmen, teachers and office workers, where 
life centered on children, school and church. The Kaczynski house was on South 
Lawndale Avenue, a quiet street of similar, equally spaced houses set on 
rectangular lawns shaded by elms. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Dr. Roy Weinberg, a neighbor, remembered the Kaczynskis as 
&quot;a serious family.&quot; 
&quot;They read books all the time,&quot; he said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But he remembered Teddy as skinny and self-absorbed. 
&quot;He was strictly 
a loner,&quot; Dr. Weinberg said. 
&quot;This kid didn't play. No. No. He was an old man before his time.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In an era of postwar prosperity, when suburbanites gathered on weekends to 
grill hamburgers, sip martinis and let the children romp, the Kaczynskis were 
different. 
&quot;They weren't part of the wild parties we used to have,&quot; one neighbor said. 
&quot;They were civic-minded folks. They really sacrificed everything they had for 
their children.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Dorothy O'Connell, who lived next door, said Wanda not only read to both boys, 
but took them to science and art museums and other cultural institutions. Both 
were bright, she said, but David was more outgoing, an avid learner and 
listener, and children and adults took to him more naturally.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But Teddy was increasingly withdrawn, lurking in the background and taking 
refuge in his reading and his thoughts. 
&quot;Both boys were more 
interested in books than sports,&quot; Dr. Weinberg said. 
&quot;But the younger brother seemed to have friends, while his older brother was a 
loner. They were completely different, night and day.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">By the time he was 10 and in fifth grade, Teddy was deeply interested in 
science and math, with intellectual gifts obvious to teachers and other adults. 
His mother, a member of the parent-teacher association, made no secret of her 
pride in her son's mind.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">It was also apparent that Teddy was far ahead of his classmates, and his school 
let him skip a grade, further isolating the friendless boy, placing him with a 
new group of older children and reinforcing the message he had heard all his 
life -- that he was valued only for his intellect.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The system needs scientists, mathematicians and engineers. It can't function 
without them. So heavy pressure is put on children to excel in these fields. 
It isn't natural for an adolescent human being to spend the bulk of his time 
sitting at a desk absorbed in study. A normal adolescent wants to spend his 
time in active contact with the real world.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Among primitive peoples the things that children are trained to do tend to be 
in reasonable harmony with natural human impulses. Among the American Indians, 
for example, boys were trained in active outdoor pursuits -- just the sort of 
thing that boys like. But in our society children are pushed into studying 
technical subjects, which most do grudgingly.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">from the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> manifesto

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Teddy became an obsessive reader. When he was 10, the Kaczynskis went on a 
camping trip -- the father often took them out in the summer and taught them to 
appreciate the woods, plants and animals -- and for vacation reading, Teddy 
took along a 
volume of 
&quot;Romping Through Mathematics from Addition to Calculus,&quot; Ms. O'Connell recalled.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Teddy had also begun using his intellect as a rapier. Ms. O'Connell recalled 
that one day he overheard her 3-year-old daughter mispronounce 
&quot;grasshopper.&quot; He stopped on the sidewalk and lectured the bewildered child on the genealogy 
of grasshoppers.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">His aunt still remembers the cut of his arrogance. 
&quot;Once when I was over to his home, he was just sitting there, and his father 
said to him, 'Why don't you have some conversation with your aunt?' And he 
answered: 'Why should I? She wouldn't understand me anyway.' 
&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">As Teddy entered his teens, his social handicaps were increasingly apparent. 
David said his brother sometimes joined him and his friends in a softball game 
on the playground, even though they were far younger. The same thing happened 
later in life, too. 
&quot;The contacts were through me in a sense,&quot; David said. 
&quot;The important thing was the relationship with me, or I'm a 
buffer. That made him feel safe.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The moral code of our society is so demanding that no one can think, feel and 
act in a completely moral way. For example, we are not supposed to hate anyone, 
yet almost everyone hates somebody at some time or other, whether he admits it 
to himself or not.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;In order to avoid feelings of guilt, they continually have to deceive 
themselves about their own motives and find moral explanations for feelings and 
actions that in reality have a non-moral origin. We use the term oversocialized 
to describe such people. Oversocialization can lead to low self-esteem, a sense 
of powerlessness, defeatism, guilt, etc. If a particular child is especially 
susceptible to such feelings, he ends by feeling ashamed of HIMSELF.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">from the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> manifesto

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> By the time he entered Evergreen Park Community High School, 
Teddy was having more trouble fitting in. He joined the band, playing the 
trombone; he joined math club, coin club, biology club, German club.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But most classmates and club members regarded him as alien, or not at all. To 
Bill Phelan, Teddy was a nerd: thin, short, quiet, painfully shy. 
&quot;He was reading books, and I was playing sports and drinking beer,&quot; Mr. Phelan said. 
&quot;He wasn't in my world. He was in his own world.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Jerry Peligrano's fleeting memory was of a bespectacled kid with pencils in a 
pocket protector. And Loren De Young remembered him as a kind of nonperson. 
&quot;He was never really seen as a person, as an individual personality,&quot; he said. 
&quot;He was always regarded as a walking brain, so to speak.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Eventually, Teddy moved into a small coterie of intellectual boys who were 
drawn together 
by a mutual passion for science and math. With one exception, perhaps, the 
half-dozen boys, members of the math club, were not real friends. They regarded 
him as immature, but tolerated him as a fellow oddball: They were chess players 
with Elvis pompadours, teen-age pipe smokers marveling at Isaac Asimov and Ray 
Bradbury and fantasizing about landing on the moon.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Ted was technically very bright, but emotionally deficient,&quot; said Patrick Morris, a group member. 
&quot;While the math club would sit around talking about the big issues of the day, 
Ted would be waiting for someone to fart. He had a fascination with body sounds 
more akin to a 5-year-old than a 15-year-old.&quot; Once, Mr. Morris said, they were talking seriously about their futures. 
&quot;Ted seemed more interested in smearing 
cake frosting on this guy's nose,&quot; he said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">They all had a passion for devilish pranks, especially explosive ones, and 
sometimes they mixed compounds of ammonia and iodine that would pop loudly but 
harmlessly in a classroom, sending up purplish smoke. 
&quot;It was our way of fitting in, showing we could be cool too,&quot; a math club member said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mr. Morris recalled that Teddy once showed a school wrestler how to make a more 
powerful mini-bomb. It went off one day in a chemistry class, blowing out two 
windows and inflicting temporary hearing damage on a girl. Everyone was 
reprimanded, but Teddy was unfazed. He later set off blasts that echoed across 
the neighborhood and sent garbage cans flying. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Russell Mosny, a math club member, 
may have come closest to friendship with Teddy. In the young Kaczynski's attic 
bedroom, they played chess and talked of equations and physics. Mr. Mosny had 
expected to read about Teddy someday as the winner of the Nobel Prize or the 
inventor of a new mathematical theorem.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;He was the smartest kid in the class,&quot; Mr. Mosny said. 
&quot;He was just quiet and shy until you got to know him. Once he knew you, he could 
talk and talk.&quot; But when the others began attending dances and dating, Teddy stayed home, Mr. 
Mosny said. 
&quot;I'd try to get him to go to the sock hops, but he always said he'd rather play 
chess or read a book.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Concerned over his social development, the Kaczynskis consulted school guidance 
counselors, but never took Teddy to a psychiatrist or psychologist, David said. 
Teddy often went into moody depressions, retreating to his bedroom 
for days on end, coming down only for meals. 
&quot;He was not happy in school,&quot; David said. 
&quot;I think he had become during adolescence more withdrawn.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Teddy skipped another grade and after only three years, graduated from high 
school in 1958, and won a scholarship to Harvard. He was only 16. 
&quot;The thought was, if he went to a university, such as Harvard, he might not have 
the pressure to conform in a working-type class community like Evergreen Park, 
and that the experience might be liberating for him socially,&quot; David explained.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Just after graduation, David recalled, Teddy dated a girl once or twice, but 
ended the relationship by expressing exasperation with her Catholic beliefs. It 
was typical of Ted, David said, that he would seize upon some pretext for 
finding fault, and then use it as an 
excuse to cut off communication.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">With all his social handicaps, Teddy was about to be thrust onto a 
high-powered, prestigious campus. He was younger by two years than most, and by 
all accounts, emotionally unprepared for the competition that lay ahead.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;They packed him up and sent him to Harvard before he was ready,&quot; Mr. Mosny said. 
&quot;He didn't even have a driver's license.&quot;

The College Student

Trying to Stay In His Own World 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The oversocialized person is kept on a psychological leash and spends his life 
running on rails society has laid down for him. In many oversocialized people 
this results in a sense of constraint and powerlessness that can be a severe 
hardship. We suggest that oversocialization is among the more serious cruelties 
that human beings inflict on one another.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">from the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> manifesto

</p><p class="body" align="Left">He may have been brilliant, but what they remembered about him at 
Harvard were his annoying trombone blasts in the dead of night, the primordial 
stench of rotting food that drifted from his room, his odd metronomic habit of 
rocking back and forth on a chair as he studied, and his icy aloofness as he 
strode through the suite, saying nothing, slamming his door to shut them out.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Theodore J. Kaczynski seemed to spend all his time studying, but he was an 
undistinguished undergraduate. He made no honors lists and earned only average 
grades. A dozen mathematics department professors and tutors who had been his 
contemporaries said they had no recollection of him.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">At Harvard, some of the most talented students in the nation compete not only 
for grades, but for leadership in a galaxy of extracurricular activities. But 
Mr. Kaczynski's yearbook entries list no activities outside his studies, and 
there is no record of an optional 
senior thesis by him.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In his freshman year, 1958-59, he lived in a small house at 8 Prescott Street, 
outside Harvard Yard in Cambridge. A housemate, Ronald L. Bauer, a California 
judge now, called it a low-rent place for a dozen freshmen. The house proctor, 
Francis Murphy, remembered Mr. Kaczynski as a lonely boy with poor hygiene who 
befriended no one.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the next three years, Mr. Kaczynski lived in a seven-man suite at Eliot 
House, one of a dozen residential dormitories overlooking the Charles River, 
but he had almost no contact with his suitemates.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">One suitemate, Patrick McIntosh, now a Colorado astronomer, said that in three 
years, 
&quot;I don't recall 
more than 10 words being spoken by him.&quot; What was memorable, he said, were the trombone blasts and foul odors from his 
junkyard room.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Ted's room had a good view of the river, but I never saw anybody live in such 
an unkempt place,&quot; Mr. McIntosh said. 
&quot;In some places, the papers and such were a foot deep. That disturbed me, that 
someone could live in such filth. The worst part was when it began to smell. 
Maybe it was rancid milk.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Another suitemate, Keith Martin, said Mr. Kaczynski would march in from class, 
walk to his room past everyone and slam his door. That would be it for the 
night, he said. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;He was intensely introverted,&quot; Mr. McIntosh said of Mr. Kaczynski. 
&quot;He wouldn't allow us to know him. I never met anybody like him who was as 
extreme in avoiding socialization. He would almost run to his room to avoid a 
conversation if one of us tried to approach him.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the Eliot House dining room, a large, elegant, wood-paneled chamber that 
suggests images of England's Oxford or Cambridge, Mr. Kaczynski often sat alone 
in an unfashionable jacket and tie. The dress code at all-male Harvard in the 
1960's required jackets and ties in classes and at meals.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But sometimes he was joined in the dining room by Richard Adams, a classmate 
who is now an investor from Stratham, N.H. He recalled that Eliot House at that 
time was the most preppie of the Harvard residential houses, full of cliquish 
extroverts, blue bloods and blustering athletes whose insider airs and bubbly 
chatter only compounded the problems of the mousy mathematician.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The whole varsity crew was in Eliot House,&quot; Mr. Adams said, referring to 
a muscular team that was a perennial national power. 
&quot;They were all very tall and athletic and preppie. Kaczynski and I weren't part 
of that. He was sallow, humorless, introverted, a guy who couldn't make 
conversation. Kaczynski wore non-modish clothes: a kind of unpleasant plaid 
sports jacket and a tie that didn't go with it. He didn't look happy.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">There were many reasons for his isolation -- his age, his noninvolvement in 
extra-curricular activities, his lack of sophistication, his single-minded 
focus on academics, his alienated outsider's pride. But Mr. Adams summed up the 
Kaczynski problem more tersely. 
&quot;He was a wonk. He epitomized that,&quot; Mr. Adams said. 
&quot;He felt fairly comfortable in that role.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">David Kaczynski said his brother wrote some letters home, and one mentioned 
&quot;a girl he kind of admired from afar.&quot; He added, 
&quot;He eventually 
asked her for a date and was rebuffed.&quot; If Ted was miserable, he never mentioned it, David said. He was 
&quot;a person who nursed a sense of injury.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Ted returned to Evergreen Park in the summers and spent most of his time in his 
room. David said his brother liked classical music and folk singers, but 
disliked 
&quot;products of the mass culture.&quot; He did not like television or rock 'n' roll, and loud noises infuriated him, 
David said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mr. Kaczynski graduated from Harvard with a mathematics degree in 1962, just 
days after he turned 20. He never recorded his feelings toward the school or 
his classmates, except perhaps in the most oblique way. In a report for the 
20th and 25th reunions of the Harvard Class of '62, he listed his address as 
788 Banchat Pesh, Khadar Khel, Afghanistan.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">No such place 
exists.

The Graduate Scholar

Colleagues Awed By His Brilliance 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The nation stood on the brink of space and the Vietnam War in the autumn of 
1962, when Mr. Kaczynski arrived at Ann Arbor to begin five years of graduate 
studies at the University of Michigan. He went about his business, enrolling in 
a master's degree program in mathematical analysis, and taking a part-time job 
as a teaching fellow. He would hold that job for three academic years.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In contrast to Harvard, Michigan was vast and impersonal, a city-sized campus 
with 35,000 students of diverse backgrounds, most of them fiercely competitive. 
But there was a niche for everyone: a team, a club or a cause, and a cave for 
those who wanted none of it. That suited Mr. Kaczynski, who took a single 
dormitory 
room in Prescott House in his first two years, and then an apartment on Packard 
Street. Mr. Kaczynski is not known to have developed any friendships or 
interests outside his academic work.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Mathematics seemed to be the only thing he was interested in,&quot; said Prof. Peter L. Duren, who taught one of Mr. Kaczynski's first-year 
courses. He said he was not aware of Mr. Kaczynski's having any social life, 
but did not regard that as unusual. 
&quot;A lot of mathematicians are a little bit strange in one way or another,&quot; he said. 
&quot;It goes with creativity.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Other professors also remembered him as a quiet loner, unusually dedicated to 
mathematics even by the standards of graduate students. He was meticulous, 
wrote with a draftsman's hand and provided more proofs than needed. He was one 
of the few students who regularly wore a 
jacket and tie to class. And he stood out in other ways, too. While teachers at 
Harvard could not even remember Mr. Kaczynski, professors at Michigan were 
impressed.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;He did not make mistakes,&quot; said Prof. George Piranian, who presided over a full-year course in advanced 
function theory in Mr. Kaczynski's second year. 
&quot;He was very persistent in his work. If a problem was hard, he worked harder. He 
was easily the top student, or one of the top.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The professor was especially impressed with the young man's original research 
into the properties of functions in circles. 
&quot;Another mathematician, a very competent man, had worked with me on that 
problem, and we got nowhere on it,&quot; he recalled. But Mr. Kaczynski solved it and submitted his solution to 
academic journals for publication without telling his professors or classmates.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">When articles bearing his name as author 
began to appear in respected academic journals, professors and students in the 
mathematics department were amazed. 
&quot;The faculty, I think, wasn't aware of this until he had published papers coming 
out in the journals,&quot; Professor Duren said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">David Kaczynski said there had always been a 
&quot;covertness&quot; in his brother's creative work. 
&quot;It was something he did not talk about,&quot; David recalled.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Fellow students were awed. 
&quot;While most of us were just trying to learn how to arrange logical statements 
into coherent arguments, Ted was quietly solving open problems and creating new 
mathematics,&quot; said Joel H. Shapiro, now a mathematics professor at Michigan State 
University. 
&quot;It was as if he could write poetry while the rest of us were trying to learn 
grammar.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mr. Kaczynski was awarded his master's degree in 1964, and stayed on at 
Michigan to work 
for a doctorate, a task that would consume the next three years and lead to his 
most productive academic period.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The time was one of tumultuous protests over civil rights and the expansion of 
the war in Vietnam. At Michigan, birthplace of the radical Students for a 
Democratic Society, the movement came almost to dominate life.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But Mr. Kaczynski took no part, professors and classmates said, although his 
principal thesis adviser, Prof. Allen L. Shields, was a vocal critic of the 
war. Nor did Mr. Kaczynski join Project Michigan, an Army weapons development 
program that some graduate students worked on at Willow Run Laboratory, which 
became a main target of protests. 
&quot;I am not aware that Ted was in any way involved with that or was taking any 
side,&quot; Professor Piranian said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">During the 
summers, Mr. Kaczynski lived with his parents, who by 1966 had moved to Lisbon, 
Iowa, a town of 1,450, 15 miles east of Cedar Rapids. His father had taken a 
job there as manager of Cushion-Pak, a maker of foam stuffing for pillows and 
sofas, and his mother had enrolled as an English major at the University of 
Iowa, in Iowa City. David was a student at Columbia University, majoring in 
English.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Diana Shelton, a grocery clerk who then worked as a foam-cutter at Cushion-Pak 
in Lisbon, remembered how the young Mr. Kaczynski had appeared at Cushion-Pak 
after a few days camping alone at nearby Coralville Lake, a semi-wilderness 
area. And his comments -- in retrospect, a harbinger of his Montana hermitage 
-- were so remarkable she 
never forgot them.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;He brought in a bunch of roots and weeds and things, and he was showing them to 
us,&quot; Ms. Shelton recalled. 
&quot;He said they were all good to eat. He told us that some of them tasted like 
potatoes. He was kind of shy and unusually quiet. But he didn't seem strange. I 
mean, the roots were edible.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;An ideology, in order to gain enthusiastic support, must have a positive ideal 
as well as a negative one; it must be FOR something as well as AGAINST 
something. The positive ideal that we propose is Nature. That is, WILD nature: 
those aspects of the functioning of the earth and its living things that are 
independent of human management and free of human interference and control. . . 
.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;When primitive man needed food he knew how to find and prepare edible roots, 
how to track game and take it with home-made weapons.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">from the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> manifesto

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Back at Ann Arbor, 
Mr. Kaczynski devoted himself to writing about ever-deeper mathematical ideas. 
One of his articles, 
&quot;Boundary Functions for Functions Defined in a Disk,&quot; was published in the Journal of Mathematics and Mechanics in 1965, and 
another, 
&quot;On a Boundary Property of Continuous Functions,&quot; appeared in the Michigan Mathematics Journal in 1966.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Both were close to the cutting edge of mathematics at the time. 
&quot;I would guess that maybe 10 or 12 people in the country understood or 
appreciated it,&quot; said Prof. Maxwell O. Reade, who was on Mr. Kaczynski's dissertation committee.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mr. Kaczynski rarely consulted with his professors. Professor Duren said, 
&quot;He just came in with carefully prepared sheets of manuscripts and said, 'Here's 
what I've done.' 
&quot; But his streak of independence brought on a serious setback.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">After he had put in considerable work, 
it was discovered that someone else had already solved the problem that was the 
subject of his doctoral thesis. Rather than start anew, Professor Duren said, 
Mr. Kaczynski combined the work of his two academic journal articles into a 
single paper.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">His dissertation, 
&quot;Boundary Functions,&quot; focused on a pure mathematics problem of functions -- quantities whose value 
depends on other quantities -- as they relate to circles. His ideas had no 
apparent practical application, but the paper was brilliant. He was awarded not 
only his doctorate, but also the University of Michigan's $100 Sumner B. Myers 
Prize for the best mathematical dissertation of 1967.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He also secured a position as an acting assistant professor on a tenure track 
at Berkeley. He stopped in Iowa to see his parents on his way to California 
that summer, and despite his accomplishments, David recalled, 
&quot;He didn't seem particularly gratified or 
proud or full of himself.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Indeed, David said, Ted seemed 
&quot;more and more interested in the woods.&quot;

The Professor

'I Can't Recollect This Guy' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;University intellectuals constitute the most highly socialized segment of our 
society and also the most left-wing segment. The leftist of the oversocialized 
type tries to get off his psychological leash and assert his autonomy by 
rebelling. But usually he is not strong enough to rebel against the most basic 
values of society.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">from the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> manifesto

</p><p class="body" align="Left">When Mr. Kaczynski arrived in 1967, Berkeley was a dope-smoking, burn-your-bra, 
rock 'n' roll haven for rebels and anarchists, gurus and hippies, Black 
Panthers, Third World Liberationists and LSD freaks in headbands. Sex and drugs 
were rampant; radicals staged rallies and sit-ins. Even mathematicians were 
lining up with the counterculture and antiwar movements.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But not Theodore Kaczynski.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He rented a small cottage on Regent Street, bought a tan, used 1967 Chevelle 
and began teaching. An old catalogue listed his courses as Numbers Systems, 
Introduction to the Theory of Sets, General Topology and Function Spaces.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Student questionnaires suggest that Mr. Kaczynski's students, who were only a 
few years younger, did not like him. They called his lectures next to useless, 
straight out of the textbook. Despite small classes, they said he did not seem 
to care for them or their concerns. 
&quot;He absolutely refuses to answer questions,&quot; one wrote.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Faculty colleagues also called him standoffish. Once, after playing host to the 
department's weekly faculty seminar, he declined to accompany the others for 
the traditional beer and pizza. Most could not even remember him, and those who 
did called him shy, quiet and withdrawn.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Lance W. Small, 
an assistant professor at the time, said there were about 60 members of the 
mathematics department. 
&quot;I can go down and probably tell you something about every one of those people, 
and picture them in my mind. But I can't recollect this guy, nor does anybody I 
know recollect him.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Still, Mr. Kaczynski was apparently well regarded by his superiors. Calvin 
Moore, who was vice chairman of the department, said Mr. Kaczynski got off to a 
promising start. In 1968, another of his articles, 
&quot;Note on a Problem of Alan Sutcliffe,&quot; appeared in Mathematics Magazine.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In September 1968, at the start of his second academic year at Berkeley, Mr. 
Kaczynski was elevated to assistant professor, a sign that he was regarded as 
on track for tenure. Outside his classroom, he spent most of his time writing; 
in 
1969, he published two more articles in the journals of the American 
Mathematical Society. 
&quot;That's a very respectable output, and they're in very good journals,&quot; Mr. Small said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Despite his promising future, Mr. Kaczynski resigned at the end of the term, on 
June 30, 1969. He did not give a reason, either to colleagues or his family.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;He said he was going to give up mathematics and wasn't sure what he was going 
to do,&quot; Prof. John W. Addison, the department chairman, wrote a colleague. 
&quot;He was very calm and relaxed about it on the outside. We tried to persuade him 
to reconsider, but our presentation had no apparent effect. Kaczynski seemed 
almost pathologically shy, and as far as I know, he made no close friends in 
the department.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mr. Small saw a connection between campus turmoil and Mr. Kaczynski's decision. 
&quot;I really think his views are a 
product of what was in the air in Berkeley in those days,&quot; he said. 
&quot;You could become infected by this feeling that society had taken a wrong turn. 
Terrible things were going on, and you couldn't help but be affected.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But David Kaczynski disagreed. 
&quot;It was not an antiwar gesture, something to do with the counterculture,&quot; he said. 
&quot;Both of us were in love with nature. I assume he wanted to live a richer life.&quot; As for turmoil on campus, David said: 
&quot;I think if he viewed it in any way at all, he viewed it as a fad.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">David saw the decision to quit mathematics as part of a pattern in his 
brother's life. 
&quot;He was a person who seemed capable of closing doors on things, on people, on 
stages of his life,&quot; he said. 
&quot;That cutting himself off was part of what he was about. At 
some point, it happened with me. At some point, it happened with our parents. 
As a kid, he loved his coin collection, and then he stopped collecting the 
coins. It was also true with a friend of his who would call in high school. 
'Hi, it's Mosny. Is Ted around?' 'I don't want to talk to him.' You can expand 
that whole theme of cutting oneself off.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
The Wanderer

Of Depression And Discontent 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the summer of 1969, at the age of 27, Mr. Kaczynski left Berkeley, 
determined to seek a simpler life in a remote area. His brother had just 
finished his junior year at Columbia. Together, the two drove to Canada to find 
some land for Ted to buy. 
&quot;I had a year of college to finish up,&quot; David said. 
&quot;I was purely accompanying him, to do something together as brothers.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In a two-month 
odyssey of exploration and camping, and of long talks in the car, walks in the 
woods and nights under the stars, they were together almost continuously, and 
David learned a great deal about the brother he had idolized but never 
understood.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">David recalled a disagreement over Freudian interpretations of a piece of 
literature. David was 
&quot;argued down.&quot; But he recalled the trip as 
&quot;good times.&quot; Ted was a skilled woodsman and taught David much about plants. 
&quot;I was very strongly influenced by my brother,&quot; David said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">They drove through Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia and the Yukon, 
looking at sites. In Prince George, British Columbia, 500 miles north of 
Vancouver, and not far from the Continental Divide, they found a spot. 
&quot;It was woods, a couple of miles' walk in from the highway,&quot; David said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">They staked out the 
property to prepare for filing an application for purchase, but then something 
happened. 
&quot;He became depressed,&quot; David said. 
&quot;I saw this a number of times in his life. There must be something triggering 
it, but I didn't know what it was. Looking back, I'm not sure. I believe it was 
the day before he was to put in his application for this piece of land. He shut 
down for a day. There was no interaction. It was like he was unreachable.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But the application was filed, and at summer's end they went home. On the way, 
they drove through Montana, and both were struck by the state's natural beauty.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">David returned to school, and Ted moved in with his parents, who by then had 
moved back to the Chicago area. Cushion-Pak, the Iowa company that his father 
had managed since 1966, had fallen on hard 
times, but its owner had offered the elder Kaczynski a new job with another 
business, Foam Cutting Engineers Inc., in Addison, Ill., just west of Chicago, 
in 1968.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The elder Kaczynski and his wife, who had earned her bachelor's degree in 
English from the University of Iowa, bought a one-story, three-bedroom frame 
house for $6,500 in the west Chicago suburb of Lombard. Mrs. Kaczynski began to 
teach English in an elementary school in nearby Geneva.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Lombard was a working-class town of modest homes and well-kept lawns, a 
Republican stronghold. But the Kaczynskis joined the local Democratic Club; 
they worked locally in Eugene J. McCarthy's antiwar Presidential campaign in 
1968.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Living again at home, Mr. Kaczynski kept mostly to his bedroom. 
Awaiting word on his land application, he did nothing for more than a year. His 
parents urged him to get a job, not to make money but to give him something to 
do, to ease his mind. But the effort failed. Investigators who had access to 
letters Mr. Kaczynski wrote later said the parents' efforts were interpreted by 
their brooding son as unwarranted intrusions, pressure to conform to a world he 
hated.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">During this period, Mr. Kaczynski wrote letters to publications and public 
figures on various topics. He opposed logging and had an intense dislike for 
the advertising industry, which he felt manipulated people and generated 
excessive consumption in society. He once wrote an angry letter to a politician 
accusing him of using the manipulative techniques he despised in advertising.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The average American should be portrayed as a victim of the advertising and 
marketing industry, which has suckered him into buying 
a lot of junk that he doesn't need and that is very poor compensation for his 
lost freedom.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">from the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> manifesto

</p><p class="body" align="Left">He also wrote two letters to The Chicago Tribune, one on snowmobiles, the other 
on motorcycles. He denounced both as noisy, air-polluting machines that spoiled 
the beauties of nature.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Technology exacerbates the effects of crowding because it puts increased 
disruptive powers in people's hands. For example, a variety of noise-making 
devices: power mowers, radios, motorcycles, etc. If the use of these devices is 
unrestricted, people who want peace and quiet are frustrated by the noise.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">from the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> manifesto

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Another letter from Mr. Kaczynski was published in the Feb. 28, 1970, issue of 
The Saturday Review, a magazine that reviewed books and the arts. The letter 
attacked highway construction and the proliferation of automobiles. 
&quot;Perhaps a better solution would be to change the structure of society so that 
it becomes possible to allow people some of the freedom and independence that 
they seem to crave,&quot; Mr. Kaczynski wrote. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">He continued: 
&quot;A happily married man does not daydream about romantic love. Similarly, a man 
does not romanticize frontier freedom unless he is suffering from a lack of 
personal autonomy. Most of the problems are direct or indirect results of the 
activity of large organizations -- corporations and governments.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;It is these organizations, after all, that control the structure and 
development of society. Perhaps the most unfortunate thing that has ever 
happened to individual liberty was its being used as an excuse for the misdeeds 
of huge corporations.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Science marches on blindly, without regard to the real welfare of the human 
race or to any other standard, obedient only to the psychological needs of the 
scientists and of the government officials and corporation executives who 
provide the funds for research. . . . Industrial-technological society cannot 
be 
reformed in such a way as to prevent it from progressively narrowing the sphere 
of human freedom.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">from the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> manifesto

</p><p class="body" align="Left">His arguments with his parents over his unwillingness to work intensified. 
Finally, early in 1970, a disappointing response came from Canada on his 
application to buy the land. 
&quot;It seemed very poorly worded, to the effect that the land was not available,&quot; David said. 
&quot;He shouldn't try to visit it. It seemed they changed the policy for acquiring 
land.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Ted was crushed. 
&quot;He got very depressed,&quot; David said. 
&quot;My sense is that it went on for a couple of months, and eventually he got a 
job. It was just a job to earn a little money, laborer or construction, 
something like that.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the spring of 1970, David graduated from Columbia. Unsure what to do with 
his life, he remembered the beauty of Montana and decided to return. 
&quot;I got a 
job in a smelter, in Great Falls,&quot; he said. Meantime, Ted continued to live in Lombard. Then in the spring of 
1971, David recalled, Ted 
&quot;showed up one day&quot; in Montana, and soon he found the piece of land he wanted.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">David, who put up some money for the property, continued to work at the smelter 
and took education courses at the College of Great Falls, until 1974, when he 
moved to Lisbon, Iowa, where his parents had lived, and became a high school 
teacher. But by the early 1980's, he had retreated to the Christmas Mountains 
of West Texas, where he bought 30 acres in one of the remotest areas of the 
nation. For years, he worked summers in the Chicago area and spent winters in a 
lean-to on the Texas property.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In bad weather, he would stay in 
a neighbor's bunk house. His hair and beard grew shaggy, and he became as much 
of a loner as his brother in Montana.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
The Hermit

An Austere Life In the Montana Woods 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">When Ted Kaczynski retreated into the Montana wilderness, the world was in 
turmoil: Vietnamese were being massacred, and Charles Manson was laughing at 
slaughters. It was a world that to Mr. Kaczynski had offered no happiness, only 
an education in useless mathematics with a minor in loneliness, and a job of 
lifetime irrelevance.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Lewis and Clark County records show he bought his property in June 1971. The 
land is a shady, 1.4-acre plot a few miles southeast of the small town of 
Lincoln. The setting is strikingly beautiful, a mountain woodlands near Stemple 
Pass, just west of the Continental Divide. Cougars, bobcats, elk and the 
occasional 
grizzly bear roam the high country. The Blackfoot River runs through it like a 
dagger, carrying cutthroat, rainbow and brook trout.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the winter, the snows lay deep and silent. Temperatures often plunged to 40 
or 50 below. In the summer, the sun was molten gold, and the rain tapped softly 
on shingles and gently bent the branches of the trees. He would have a 
vegetable garden. There would be deer and rabbits to hunt. He would need little 
money. There would be no trappings of modern life, no technology. And best of 
all, he would be free, almost, of people trying to control his life.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Freedom means being in control (either as an individual or as a member of a 
SMALL group) of the life-and-death issues of one's existence: food, clothing, 
shelter and defense against whatever threats there may be in one's environment. 
Freedom means having power; not the 
power to control other people, but the power to control the circumstances of 
one's own life. One does not have freedom if anyone else (especially a large 
organization) has power over one.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">from the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> manifesto

</p><p class="body" align="Left">He built a wooden one-room cabin, 10 by 12 feet, with a storage loft and a 
dugout cellar. The cabin's faded brown planks blended into the juniper woods 
like clever camouflage. There was no electricity, no telephone and no running 
water, though he dug a well, installed a pump, got a Coleman stove and put in a 
kerosene lamp for nights and a wood stove against the dangerous winters.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the yard, he had a block and an ax for firewood and a ring of stones and a 
metal grill for cooking. The property was small, 
but the cabin was set back on a dirt road and the nearest neighbor was a 
quarter-mile away. He could scare people off with a rifle, if he had to, or 
with his shaggy mountain-man face.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The county assessor's office valued the land at $4,200 and the cabin at $350. 
The annual real estate tax was $110.26.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Dressed in black denim or army fatigues, he occasionally rode a battered old 
bicycle into town for supplies. He knew people, but did not invite small talk. 
&quot;He never would really offer any conversation,&quot; said Rhoda Burke, a cashier at the food store. 
&quot;He'd come in once or twice a month and buy his staples and put them on the back 
of his bike and ride out of town.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Now and then he used the post office pay phone. More often, he stopped at the 
Lincoln Library where 
Beverly Coleman worked. 
&quot;Sometimes he came in once a week because we saved newspapers for him and he 
picked them all up,&quot; she said. 
&quot;Just our local tribunes, from Missoula and Great Falls and Helena.&quot; He also wanted scientific books and classic literature, she said, usually in 
English, but often in the original German or Spanish. These had to be ordered 
from the University of Montana in Missoula, or Montana State at Bozeman.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Aside from his taste in books and his rarely displayed articulateness, the 
usually unwashed Mr. Kaczynski did not raise eyebrows around Lincoln, where 
many people live secluded lives. 
&quot;He was just a private person and enjoyed being up there by himself,&quot; said Joseph Youderian, who interviewed him for the 1990 census and was one of 
the few locals who entered his cabin. He saw shelves of books, a bunk, a wash 
basin and a 
man of few words. 
&quot;I didn't push it. That's the way he wanted to live.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He made his own candles and bread. He grew potatoes, parsnips and other 
vegetables, hunted rabbits, and managed with little money. Butch Gehring, whose 
house and lumber mill are a quarter-mile off, said he once heard him complain 
about his costs rising to $300 from $200 a year.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;He kept a careful record,&quot; said David, who visited Ted at his cabin in 1974 and again in 1986. 
&quot;It cost 30 cents a day,&quot; or about $110 a year. His life was largely financed by his parents, who gave 
him $1,000 to $1,500 a year in birthday and Christmas gifts. Ted wrote some 200 
letters to his parents and brother, but until 1994, David said, he never 
requested money.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">And he 
worked odd jobs. In the winter of 1973-74, David said, Ted wrote to his parents 
that he was working for several months in Salt Lake City. David, learning of 
this and on his way back to classes at the College of Great Falls, stopped in 
Salt Lake City for a visit. He found his brother staying in an old hotel. 
&quot;He told me that he was working on some kind of construction job with a small 
contractor,&quot; David said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the late summer of 1974, Ted also pumped gas and sold tires for a few weeks 
at Kibbey Korner Truck Stop in Raynesford, 100 miles east of Lincoln. It was a 
drifter's job -- a bunk went with it -- and no one held it for long, but the 
truck stop's retired owner, 
Joe Visocan, remembered Mr. Kaczynski after 22 years because of a letter he 
received after the worker quit.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Addressed to 
&quot;Dear, sweet Joe, You fat con-man,&quot; Mr. Kaczynski complained of being misled about the amount of money he might 
make on the job, demanded his last paycheck and threatened to tell the 
authorities about some equipment irregularity in the garage if he did not 
receive it.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Ted's brief sojourn in Raynesford was also notable for a crude romantic 
overture he made to a 19-year-old college student who was working as a waitress 
in the truck-stop restaurant, and for what seems to have been a revealing 
expression of his growing antipathy toward technology.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">To the waitress, Sandra Hill, he was just a shy, clean-shaven co-worker, a 
dozen years her senior. She said she had paid him little 
attention, and had no idea he was interested in her until she went back to 
school that fall and received three letters from him. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">One invited her to move with him to northern Canada and be his squaw. The 
second was almost a resume, in which he, as if applying for work, told her he 
was a Harvard graduate who had written and published papers in scientific 
journals. The third said he assumed she was not interested because she had 
ignored the first two.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Ms. Hill also remembered what may have been a glimpse of Mr. Kaczynski's 
anti-technology sentiments. An aircraft flew over one day, and Mr. Kaczynski, 
looking up, remarked that it represented something terrible for humanity. He 
spoke of air pollution and said something else about a world in which speed was 
too important.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In and around Lincoln, people did not keep track of Mr. Kaczynski's comings and 
goings. He sometimes did not appear 
in town for months. He occasionally got a ride from an acquaintance, like Dick 
Lundberg or Carol Blowars, or took a Rimrock Stage bus from Lincoln into nearby 
Helena or Missoula. He might have been gone for months at a time without anyone 
noticing.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Ted Kaczynski's cabin was far less remote than his brother's in West Texas. 
Indeed, it was only two hours from transcontinental highways traveled by 
intercity buses. Missoula on Interstate 90 linked Seattle and Chicago. Helena 
is on Interstate 15, which reaches from Canada to San Diego through Salt Lake 
City, with branches to Sacramento, Berkeley, San Francisco and all of Northern 
California.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Barbara McCabe, proprietor of the Park Hotel, a cheap place for transients in 
downtown Helena, said Mr. Kaczynski had stayed the night 
off and on for many years, taking a Spartan, $14 room with a sink and bed. 
&quot;He was very quiet,&quot; she said. 
&quot;He'd just take his key and go to his room.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Across the street at Aunt Bonnie's Bookstore, Mr. Kaczynski would stop to buy a 
book from the 25-cent rack, said Anne Haire, the owner. They were usually old, 
obscure sociology or political science texts, she said, 
&quot;the books nobody else wants to buy.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Nearby, the in-state buses leave for Butte, where one can board a Greyhound bus 
for practically anywhere in the country. Stacie Frederickson, a Greyhound agent 
in Butte, remembered ticketing Mr. Kaczynski -- 
&quot;a geeky-looking guy&quot; -- about 15 times on intercity buses south to Salt Lake City or west to the 
Coast.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But it was 
east, to Chicago, that Mr. Kaczynski traveled in the spring of 1978.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Prof. Donald Saari, of the mathematics department at Northwestern University in 
Evanston, just north of Chicago, said a man he thought was Mr. Kaczynski 
appeared at his office, without an appointment, one day in the spring of 1978.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Investigators have expressed some doubts about Professor Saari's account of 
what happened in what he said were four or five meetings with the man.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The first time, he just arrived, standing shyly outside my door, and I invited 
him to come in,&quot; the professor recalled. His clothes and awkwardness suggested a working man, 
but there were odd things about him. 
&quot;He was shy, his social graces were not the best and he tended to wear working 
clothes and working shoes. On the other hand, he did not have the firm 
handshake of someone from the working class.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Professor Saari 
said he thought the man had come to him because he wanted to attend a lecture 
series he was arranging, but the man wanted him to read a treatise he had 
written on the evils of technology. The professor said it had not been his 
understanding that the man wanted to get his 10- to 20-page treatise published.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The professor read it, nevertheless. It made an argument that technology was 
profoundly harming society, he said, but he found the ideas clumsily expressed. 
The man seemed intelligent, but the professor thought he needed guidance.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I'm dealing with a person that I think has a future, that should go back to 
school,&quot; Professor Saari said. 
&quot;He's expressing ideas amateurishly. They're not well defined or well thought 
out. But with going to school, they could be polished.&quot; He suggested that Mr. Kaczynski go to the Chicago Circle campus of the 
University of Illinois. It was less expensive than Northwestern.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">When 
Professor Saari next saw him, Mr. Kaczynski was trembling with rage at his 
treatment at the Chicago Circle campus of the University of Illinois, where his 
manuscript had been rejected.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;He was quite angry -- never raised his voice -- but he was enraged, and he was 
trembling,&quot; Professor Saari recalled. 
&quot;He told me that these highfalutin' Ph.D.'s had dismissed him from their 
offices. I guess they had looked over his manuscript and summarily dismissed 
him.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">What happened next made a deep impression on the professor.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I'll get even,&quot; Mr. Kaczynski said, shaking with rage.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Professor Saari next saw Mr. Kaczynski at a lecture by a British scholar, 
Joseph Needham, who had written extensively on the history of science and 
industry in China. The subject was gunpowder.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The first device was quite crude, a piece of pipe that might have come from a 
kitchen sink. The explosive was gunpowder and shavings of 
wooden matchheads. The wire had been pulled from an old lamp cord, and the 
triggering device was simple and dangerous.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But the container was almost a work of art, carefully fashioned from four kinds 
of wood, meticulously sanded, polished and stained, like a piece of fine 
furniture from an old-world artisan.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The package was addressed to a professor at the Chicago Circle campus of the 
University of Illinois, where it was left in a parking lot on May 24, 1978. But 
instead of being forwarded to its addressee, it was returned to its apparent 
sender, a professor at Northwestern University. Since that person had not 
actually sent the package, it was turned over to Northwestern's campus security 
force. It exploded the next day, badly injuring a guard who opened it.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">It seems mere chance that the bomb went 
off at Northwestern in Evanston, rather than at the Chicago Circle campus of 
the University of Illinois. But the address and the return address on the 
package suggests that either may have been a satisfactory target to the 
<strong>Unabomber.</strong>

The Rejected Suitor

Date Brings Joy, Then Despair 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">He went back to Lombard, back to his parents' home. This time, he did not 
resist their blandishments about work. On June 23, he took a job at the plant 
where his father worked part-time as a draftsman and where his brother, David, 
was now a supervisor. Ted was put to work as a press operator, cutting pieces 
of foam for cushions.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">His supervisor was Ellen Tarmichael, a soft-spoken but no-nonsense woman who is 
still a production manager with the company. One employee, Richard Johnson, 
called her 
&quot;a wonderful boss, the best I've ever had,&quot; and added: 
&quot;She's 
always kind-hearted and nice to people. I can see why somebody would get 
interested in her.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Ted Kaczynski became interested in late July 1978. He was 36, and she was 29.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">It was a Sunday, and he had gone for a walk. 
&quot;He happened to see her car,&quot; David recalled. 
&quot;She was filling the gas tank. I don't know exactly what transpired. He actually 
went to her apartment and played cards with her and her sister and her 
boyfriend.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Later Ted came home. 
&quot;He was obviously in a really good mood,&quot; David said. 
&quot;He told me he had gone to see Ellen, that they had spent the day together and 
had played cards, and that some gestures indicating affection had passed 
between them. I was very happy about that.&quot; He remembered something his parents had said once, about Ted eventually 
marrying and losing his 
&quot;rough edges.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">They had two dates, Ms. Tarmichael recalled. She said he seemed intelligent and 
quiet, and she accepted 
a dinner invitation in late July. It was a French restaurant, David said, and 
Ted 
&quot;ordered wine and he smelled it, he made a big deal of it.&quot; David added, 
&quot;He had a good time.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Two weeks later, they went apple-picking and afterward went to his parents' 
home and baked a pie. That was when she told him she did not want to see him 
again. 
&quot;I felt we didn't have much in common besides our employment,&quot; she said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Ted did a total shutdown,&quot; retreating into his room, David said. He also wrote an insulting limerick 
about Ms. Tarmichael, made copies and posted them in lavatories and on walls 
around the factory. He did not sign the limerick, but his relationship with the 
woman was known.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">David confronted his brother. 
&quot;I was very, very angry,&quot; he said. 
&quot;Part of me was disappointed. He was so close to being integrated in the most 
primal 
rite of integration. He had an interest in a member of the opposite sex, and to 
have him go back to this kind of angry, inappropriate behavior -- to the family 
it was embarrassing, adolescent kind of behavior.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">David told him to cease the offensive conduct. But Ted put the same limerick up 
the next day, above David's desk. David told him to go home. Ted asked if he 
was being dismissed, and David again told him to go home. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;At that time, Ted asked me if his brother could fire him,&quot; Ms. Tarmichael said. 
&quot;I replied that David could fire him and told him I, as David's manager, would 
support David's decision.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Ted, regarding himself dismissed, walked off.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">At a recent news conference, Ms. Tarmichael said that at no time was she 
&quot;romantically involved with Ted Kaczynski.&quot; She also scoffed at accounts that her rejection had somehow led to acts of 
terrorism attributed to him. 
Since the day of his dismissal, she said, she has had no contact with him.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">David said Ted wrote Ms. Tarmichael a letter that 
&quot;had elements of an apology about it.&quot; But investigators said the letter, which probably was not sent, partly blamed 
the woman for what had happened and said Ted had considered harming her. One 
investigator quoted the letter as saying she was lucky he had decided not to 
harm her.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">After Ted's dismissal, with tensions between the brothers continuing, David 
left the house in Lombard and moved back to Texas. But Ted stayed until the 
late summer or early fall of 1979. It is not clear whether he returned to 
Montana then or later.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> struck three more times in the Chicago area. On May 9, 1979, a year after the 
first attack, a bomb in a box left at Northwestern University's 
Technological Institute injured a student who tried to open it. Six months 
later, on Nov. 15, a bomb mailed from Chicago to an unknown location went off 
on an American Airlines flight from Chicago to Washington; 12 people were 
injured, but the plane landed safely. On June 10, 1980, a bomb mailed to the 
Lake Forest, Ill., home of Percy A. Wood, the president of United Airlines, 
injured Mr. Wood when he tried to open it.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the early 1980's, David said, Ted's letters to his parents began to grow 
increasingly angry. The parents had visited him several times at his cabin 
until the mid-1980's, and each time they had come away pleased at his 
cordiality, only to find another angry letter in the mail soon after 
returning home.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;With Ted, I have a sense of a person who appeared to deteriorate with time,&quot; David said. 
&quot;I recall letters he wrote to our parents that were quite loving for quite a few 
years. How you get from that to some of the angry letters, I don't know.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But Ted continued to write to his brother. 
&quot;Ted always seemed interested to know about my experiences in the desert,&quot; David said. 
&quot;He had told me on a number of occasions that Lincoln was getting too crowded. 
He felt stifled. I understand perfectly how he felt. A cabin coming up two 
miles away. It changes your lifestyle. Someone could look at you through 
binoculars, especially when your bathroom is outside. It could be a concern.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Over the next five years, from 1981 to 1985, there were seven more bombs -- at 
the University of 
Utah in Salt Lake City; at Vanderbilt University in Nashville; two at Berkeley 
(at a faculty lounge and in a computer room); at the Boeing Company in Auburn, 
Wash.; at a professor's home at the University of Michigan, and at a computer 
store in Sacramento.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The authorities knew the attacks were related because the initials 
&quot;FC&quot; were either engraved on metal parts of the bombs or spray-painted near the 
scene of the explosions. And the explosions were becoming increasingly 
dangerous.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Six people were injured during this five-year period. One person, the owner of 
the computer store in Sacramento, was killed in 1985. The 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> after nearly eight years, had committed a murder.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In 1986, David visited his brother in Montana for almost two weeks. David slept 
in 
a tent outside because, he felt, the cabin was too cramped. David was surprised 
that Ted had a battery-operated radio. 
&quot;He said -- maybe he was embarrassed because I pictured him as a purist -- it 
was not for entertainment, just the weather.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">David saw no chemicals or other items that might have aroused suspicion. 
&quot;In retrospect,&quot; David said, 
&quot;he wanted to be very specific about the day I was coming.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">One day, Ted showed him a book on Roman coins. Another day, David drove him to 
town to shop for supplies and go to the library. 
&quot;He introduced me to people that he knew,&quot; David said. 
&quot;I remember feeling pleased and reassured that he was a familiar character in 
town.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Back at the cabin, Ted 
&quot;spent some time tutoring me in Spanish,&quot; David said. 
&quot;He would have me read from some of the Spanish books. I had a sense that he 
really enjoyed doing that.&quot; 
David said he did not relish the role, but went along with it because it seemed 
to please his brother.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">It was on this visit, David recalled, that the table collapsed under him as he 
was sawing wood outside. Ted touched his shoulders, and David felt a closeness 
to his brother greater than any he could remember.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> was always careful. He never left fingerprints. The stamps on his packages 
were never licked, lest saliva become evidence for DNA experts. He was always 
well away when his explosions occurred. But on Feb. 20, 1987, when one of his 
bombs went off outside a Salt Lake City computer store and injured an employee, 
something extraordinary happened. A woman nearby spotted the man who had left 
the bomb package. He looked right at her, and she remembered him clearly: a 
hooded sweatshirt, a mustache, reddish-brown hair, a square jaw and menace lurking behind the aviator sunglasses.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He panicked. The bomber, who had meticulously covered his tracks for nearly a 
decade, had made a mistake.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He fled.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">And as the woman's description became a sketch that found its way into 
newspapers and magazines across the country, he retreated into the shadows and 
halted his bombing campaign for six years.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
The Correspondent

Letters of Friendship, Letters of Anger 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Ted Kaczynski began a strange new interlude in 1988 -- a correspondence with a 
man he would never meet. It would last seven years and become his most 
sustained relationship with a person outside his family.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">He had continued to receive letters and cash holiday gifts from his parents and 
David. But that autumn, he received an unusual letter in Spanish from Ojinaga, 
Mexico, from Juan Sanchez Arreola, who introduced himself as a 
friend of his brother. He said he had been hurt in a pickup truck accident and 
asked for financial help.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In a meticulous handwritten response in stilted Spanish on lined three-ring 
binder paper and dated Nov. 14, 1988, Mr. Kaczynski said he would try to help, 
though he made no promises. He wrote: 
&quot;I am pleased that you call yourself my friend. And I, in turn, call myself your 
friend.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Thus began a correspondence -- an odd blend of warmth yet distant formality 
sometimes associated with communications across a linguistic or cultural gap -- 
between 
&quot;Teodoro&quot; and a married, 60-year-old farmhand with two years of schooling. They would 
eventually write some 50 letters each, and Mr. Kaczynski would offer a 
circumspect picture of his life, from mundane weather reports to 
detailed descriptions of rabbit-hunting, from expressions of concern over his 
poverty to confessions of loneliness.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">David recalled, 
&quot;Ted said he didn't know what it was, but Juan touched him very deeply, and 
there are a number of instances throughout Ted's life when he was very, very 
deeply touched and sympathetic toward someone's pain he could understand, and 
Juan was one of these cases.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">David said Ted wanted to do something for Mr. Sanchez, but his solution 
&quot;reveals that in some ways he was out of touch.&quot; 
&quot;He read about a millionaire who would receive requests for money and decide who 
to give it to. Ted decided this was the best way to get help for Juan, to pay 
his medical bills, and he drafted a letter that he sent to me. I was supposed 
to get an O.K. from Juan and send it to the millionaire. And of course, we 
never heard. For an intelligent person it seemed so . . . 
extremely naive.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mr. Sanchez had continued to write to David, as well, and had encouraged him to 
write to Linda Patrik, a girl he had remembered as a friend and lab partner 
from high school. 
&quot;He had to teach me to write a love letter,&quot; David said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In 1989, David told his brother he had a relationship with Linda and had 
decided to go to Schenectady, N.Y., to be with her. He also said he expected to 
marry her.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;At that time he decided to end his relationship with me, end communicating with 
me,&quot; David said. 
&quot;It was an extremely angry, total surprise to me. He tended to view me as 
someone who was easily manipulated by others and for some reason he had gotten 
the notion that Linda was a manipulating female who was using me.&quot; The accusation seemed particularly bizarre, David said, because 
&quot;he has never met her to my knowledge.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">One interpretation of his brother's letter, he said, might be that Ted was 
disappointed that he would give up the lifestyle they had shared. 
&quot;It 
may have just been terrible for him to think I would rejoin society,&quot; David said. 
&quot;I think it goes deeper than that.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">David said the letter had contained 
&quot;a long litany&quot; of his presumed faults but it added that 
&quot;he did care about me&quot; and said that 
&quot;I was throwing away my life.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">By marrying? he was asked.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Sure.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Seeing Linda as manipulative, though he had never met her, was typical, David 
said. 
&quot;He would remember something that my father said or my mother said, and it would 
be great weight, and he would attach some significance to it. He would build 
out of a few facts a picture that was unrecognizable.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">From then on, Ted told David, he would not open a letter from his brother 
unless it had a line drawn under the stamp to indicate a family emergency. 
David had been cut off. Then, a few weeks later, David received 
an amendment from Ted.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;It was an awkward apology for the tone of what he said,&quot; David recalled. But there was a new element: Ted said he had developed a heart 
arrhythmia that 
&quot;made him fear for his life.&quot; It had been brought on by anger, and he said he had decided to limit his 
communications to ease the stress.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">David said he had no idea whether Ted actually had a heart problem, but he said 
there had been no apparent ill effects after years of talk about it. He also 
said his brother had expressed frequent concerns about germs, infections and 
other health matters. 
&quot;This kind of worry about -- not hypochondria -- just worry about his health is 
a recurring theme,&quot; David said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;My reading of things is that Ted did not have a real good grip on his own 
emotions, and this was clearly an example of an effect, the way his 
emotions became something he could not control. Clearly, he was afraid of the 
way his heart would beat when he got angry. He couldn't control it. The only 
way he could control it was by eliminating the trigger.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The only way was, don't write me any more. Don't make me angry any more.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In later letters to 
&quot;My very dear and esteemed friend,&quot; Mr. Sanchez, Ted told of being alienated from his family. Mr. Sanchez quoted 
him as saying he was 
&quot;on bad terms&quot; with his parents and 
&quot;doesn't want anything to do with them.&quot; And Mr. Sanchez said: 
&quot;David once told me that Teodoro called his mother a dog. It is very sad when 
someone doesn't love his parents.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Ted's father, who had visited him at his cabin and had left in disgust at the 
way his older son was living, had retired from part-time work when he was 
diagnosed with lung cancer in the late 1980's. When his 
condition began to deteriorate, his family informed Ted in a letter. His 
response was a brief call from the Lincoln post office.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">On Oct. 2, 1990, Theodore R. Kaczynski shot himself to death in his home in 
Lombard. Ted was informed of his death, but did not attend the memorial service 
in Illinois. But he did call during that service to offer condolences to his 
mother, and David's reaction was to worry about his brother. 
&quot;I often thought about that conversation,&quot; he said. He envisioned Ted at a pay phone, awkwardly trying to express 
condolences to a mother he had ignored for years. 
&quot;That's a Ted that's human, who I understand and love,&quot; David said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">His mother afterward wrote Ted and, David said, 
&quot;invited him to talk about the things that had been painful to him as a child 
and in their relationship.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The answer was scathing. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;It 
began sort of mildly and in the course of the letter it built up and up, and by 
the end of the letter he was using fairly offensive epithets,&quot; David said. It was a 17- or 18-page indictment of his parents, accusing them 
of being 
&quot;more interested in having a brilliant son than seeing that son happy and 
fulfilled.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Was it a valid accusation? 
&quot;No,&quot; David said, 
&quot;I believe he may very well believe that. When he decided to end his career 
after they invested so much of themselves . . .&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Ted also said he had never had a real friend in all his life, and recalled a 
painful incident in gym class when he was 16. 
&quot;The kids had picked out their sides, and he was the odd man out. Nobody picked 
him. He said, 'I am crying as I write this.' 
&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The exchange continued, David said. 
&quot;My mother wrote back saying, 'Look, 
Ted, you know you're handsome. You know you're smart. There's no reason you 
can't have the kind of life you want.' He was so angry about that. To me it 
sounded like encouragement, but he took it to be something -- a part of him I 
absolutely can't explain.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Ted did not attend David's 1991 wedding to Ms. Patrik in a modest backyard 
Buddhist ceremony in Schenectady. Marriage drastically changed David's life. He 
gave up the Texas outback for a home in Schenectady and a job at Equinox, an 
Albany agency that helps runaway youths. His wife has been a professor of 
philosophy at Union College, in Schenectady, for 18 years.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The marriage also apparently snapped Ted's last thread to David, though he 
would make later requests for money.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Early in the summer of 1993, a 
few months after an enormous explosion rocked the World Trade Center in New 
York, killing six people and injuring hundreds, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> resumed a campaign that had been suspended for six years. His new bombs were 
far more sophisticated and deadly. They were mailed from, or planted in, Utah 
or Northern California.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">On June 22, a bomb mailed to a Tiburon, Calif., home exploded and severely 
injured a University of California geneticist. Two days later, a similar bomb 
badly injured a computer science professor at Yale University in New Haven. 
Both bombs had been postmarked in Sacramento.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">On the day of the Yale blast, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> spoke to the world for the first time. A letter to The New York Times, 
postmarked San Francisco and bearing the 
&quot;FC&quot; trademark, claimed that the 
bombings were the work of an anarchist group. It promised further communiques 
and gave a nine-digit code -- 553-25-4394 -- that it said would be included for 
authentication on future writings.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Under great pressure to find the bomber, investigators developed a profile 
calling the suspect a loner, highly intelligent, meticulous, a quiet man who 
made lists and had trouble dealing with people, especially women, perhaps a 
sullen student or teacher. Tens of thousands of leads were pursued, all to no 
avail. They needed something more.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In Lincoln, Mr. Kaczynski was always short of money. In the summer of 1994, the 
bearded, unkempt hermit approached Becky Garland, then manager of a 
clothing-sporting goods store. He told her he was almost broke and needed work. 
They agreed to meet and talk. They sat on the store 
porch a few days later, and he gave her a letter, part resume and part 
self-description.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">It was an extraordinary revelation, mentioning his Harvard and graduate 
degrees, and making brief references to his loneliness. It had been 16 years 
since his date with Ellen Tarmichael.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I think he wrote the letter so he didn't have to speak about these things, so 
he didn't have to talk a lot,&quot; Ms. Garland said. 
&quot;He wrote about being with classmates who were older, and about being very shy. 
He did write about a relationship with someone at one time that didn't work out.&quot; A 20-minute talk ensued, and minimal as it was, he revealed more of himself 
than he had in 23 years in Lincoln.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;We use the term 'surrogate activity' to designate an activity that is directed 
toward an artificial goal that people set up for 
themselves merely in order to have some goal to work toward, or let us say, 
merely for the sake of the 'fulfillment' that they get from pursuing the goal. 
. . . The pursuit of sex and love (for example) is not a surrogate activity 
because most people, even if their existence were otherwise satisfactory, would 
feel deprived if they passed their lives without ever having a relationship 
with a member of the opposite sex. But pursuit of an excessive amount of sex, 
more than one really needs, can be a surrogate activity.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">from the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> manifesto

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Ms. Garland did not keep the letter, and no job came of it. Mr. Kaczynski did 
not press the matter. He may have been too busy, investigators say, for it was 
then that he began to spend a great deal of time at his cabin writing on a 
battered old typewriter. He also wrote to David, requesting money.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">While investigators have denied 
it, several published reports have suggested that Mr. Kaczynski's name appeared 
in 1994 in an Federal of Bureau Investigation file in connection with Earth 
First, an environmentalist group that uses confrontational tactics against 
timber and other development companies.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">According to these reports, Mr. Kaczynski was said to have gone to the campus 
of the University of Montana at Missoula in November 1994, and attended a 
meeting of 500 environmentalists from all over the world who gathered to 
coordinate opposition to multinational corporations.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Thomas Fullum, an organizer of the meeting, did not recall Mr. Kaczynski 
specifically, but said that the discussions had alluded to the role of a public 
relations agency, Burson-Marsteller, a unit of Young 
&amp; Rubicam Inc., and its work for Exxon Corporation. There were erroneous 
assertions at the meeting that Burson-Marsteller had tried to repair the 
company's image 
after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Among the many publications available to those who attended the meeting was The 
Earth First Journal, which contained denunciations of the timber industry and 
its lobbyists.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">On Dec. 10, 1994, a mail bomb killed Thomas J. Mosser at his home in North 
Caldwell, N.J. Mr. Mosser, an advertising executive for Young 
&amp; Rubicam who specialized in crisis communications, had once worked for 
Burson-Marsteller, but neither he nor that agency had been employed on the 
Exxon Valdez incident.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In mid-April 1995, Mr. Kaczynski, having again asked for and received money 
from his brother, left Lincoln and traveled by bus to Sacramento. At a Burger 
King restaurant next to the bus terminal in Sacramento, Mike Singh, the 
manager, remembered him. He was carrying what appeared to be an armful of 
books. He had a sandwich and a cup of coffee and left.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mr. Kaczynski took a room at the Royal Hotel, next door to the bus station. A 
desk clerk, Frank Hensley, remembered him because he had stayed there 
periodically in recent years, usually in spring or summer, for three days to a 
week at a time. He used the name Conrad to sign the registration book, and took 
a $22.50-a-night room without a bath.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The hotel was not far from the Sacramento post office.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">On April 24, 1995, five days after the bombing of the Federal Building in 
Oklahoma City, which killed 168 people in the worst act of terrorism in the 
nation's history, a package arrived at the Sacramento office of the California 
Forestry Association, a timber industry lobbying group. 
It was addressed to a former association president, but was opened by his 
successor, Gilbert P. Murray, who was killed by the explosion.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">It was the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> last bomb.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">That same day, a letter that had been mailed from Oakland a day after the 
Oklahoma City bombing arrived at the offices of The New York Times in New York. 
The letter was crudely typed, with phrases crossed out with X's, more typical 
of work on a typewriter than a computer. But it gave the 
<strong>Unabomber's</strong> nine-digit code, and it offered an explanation for 17 years of deadly serial 
bombings.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;The people we are out to get are scientists and engineers, especially in 
critical fields like computers and genetics,&quot; it said. The goal, it said, was nothing less than 
&quot;the destruction of the worldwide industrial system.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The letter ridiculed David 
J. Gelernter, a Yale computer professor who lost an eye in one of the 1993 
bombings, and said Mr. Mosser had been killed because he worked for 
Burson-Marsteller and that company 
&quot;manipulated people's attitudes.&quot; It was mistaken in asserting that Mr. Mosser currently worked for Burson 
Marsteller and that that agency had tried to 
&quot;clean up&quot; Exxon's image.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But the significance of the letter was unmistakable. After 17 years of 
seemingly random attacks, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> had changed tactics and offered a statement on his motives. Moreover, he said 
he wanted to fully detail his reasons for bombing and was working on a long 
manuscript for publication.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">But talking to the world entailed enormous risks. It meant that his words, his 
vocabulary, his typewriter and the very paper he would write upon, would all 
become clues to his hidden identity.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Two months later, he threatened to blow 
up a jetliner out of Los Angeles, causing wide panic and security precautions. 
Then he called it a prank. With the nation paying attention at last, he sent 
his 35,000-word manifesto to The Times and The Washington Post and said he 
would stop the killing if it were published in three months. The Post published 
it, with The Times sharing the costs, last September.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">David Kaczynski read the manifesto and, with growing alarm, began a private 
inquiry, comparing the document with his brother's old letters and essays. He 
saw striking similarities in the prose style and the anti-technology content. 
He had already begun thinking about the locales of Unabom explosions and how 
similar they were to the places where his brother had lived or studied. By 
February, David, after agonizing over his findings, had turned to the F.B.I.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Agents searching a shed at the old Kaczynski home in Lombard 
found matches, traces of gunpowder and other compounds like those used in the 
earliest Unabom explosions in the Chicago area in 1978, 1979 and 1980. Wanda 
Kaczynski knew nothing about all this. She had just sold the home in Lombard 
for $100,000, and had moved to Schenectady to be near David.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The county trunk is an unpaved road that snakes south out of Lincoln, turns 
east and rises up into the high country toward Stemple Pass, which cuts through 
the Rocky Mountains at 6,373 feet. Five miles from town, just short of the 
pass, a muddy side road branches off up a hillside and disappears into the 
dense aspen and juniper woods. That's where the men went.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">They might have been taken for hunters, if anyone had noticed them out in the 
snow. They had guns and binoculars, and they moved cautiously, like stalkers. 
They had rented rooms 
at a hotel in town in February, but people had been too nosy and they had moved 
to two cabins on a ridge up near the pass. Only Butch Gehring, who lived up 
there, knew who they were, and he had been sworn to secrecy.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">For 18 days, they watched, peering down through the winter woods with their 
binoculars and telescopes. Elk and deer, and once a cougar, crossed their 
lenses. But by late March, they had not seen the mountain man. They knew he 
often stayed in for weeks, but they began to wonder. Mr. Gehring was sent to 
check. He and a forest ranger confirmed that the hermit had not slipped away.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Waco and Ruby Ridge preyed on the watchers' minds: They wanted no blunders, no 
needless violence. But their force was growing -- up to 50 men were holed up in 
the area -- and secrecy could 
not be assured indefinitely.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">They picked a cold, overcast day, April 3. Showers of snow and sleet fell from 
time to time. A mountain wind moaned and lifted the pine boughs. Canyon Creek 
gurgled with the spring melt. They formed a great circle, moving down the 
hillside and up the muddy road. Mr. Gehring went along.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">As they drew near, they came across a shed where the carcasses of several 
animals had been dressed and hung out to dry. Nearer still, a plot of ground 
lay cleared for a garden, enclosed by a tall wire fence to keep out the deer. A 
ring of cold stones marked a campfire-cookery.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The cabin, with a steep roof of green tarpaper, was a crude wooden shack, its 
reddish-brown walls faded by many winters, a 
rustic coarseness against the gnarled bark of the woods. It was impossible to 
see in; two small windows were set high up to catch the light but keep out 
prying eyes. A jumble of bottles and cans lay heaped like a medieval midden 
beside the cabin door.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The door itself was hinged and fitted with a hasp for a padlock, useful for 
locking up when the mountain man was away. But he was here now, silent inside, 
his door secured by a deadbolt.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">They used a little ruse. Mr. Gehring shouted, something about the ranger 
needing help to fix the line between their adjoining properties.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The door opened, and a shaggy man stepped out.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">They took his arms from both sides.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Ted,&quot; one of them said. 
&quot;We need to talk.&quot;
