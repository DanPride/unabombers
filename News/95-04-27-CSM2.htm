</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The US
</p><p class="body" align="Left">James and Terry Nichols, previously held as witnesses in last week's truck-bomb 
explosion in Oklahoma City, were charged as conspirators with Timothy McVeigh 
in the construction of explosive devices in Michigan. McVeigh remained the only 
person arrested in the actual bombing of the federal building. A radio station 
in San Clemente, Calif., dropped controversial talk show host G. Gordon Liddy 
from its programming, saying Liddy's views ''foster and encourage extremist 
action.'' At press time, the death toll from the bombing stood at 96. (Stories, 
Page 1.)

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Senators Dole and Hatch said they would coordinate efforts with White House 
officials to strengthen antiterrorism laws. Senator Daschle warned against 
measures that could infringe on personal rights. Six members of Congress 
earlier wrote to Attorney General Reno to 
caution against a raid on militia groups. They said such actions could be ''a 
precursor to martial law.'' In a CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll, 72 percent of the 
respondents said the federal government should actively investigate and 
infiltrate armed resistance groups ''even if doing so may infringe on their 
constitutional rights.''
 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI, investigating a mail bombing that killed a timber industry lobbyist in 
his Sacramento, Calif., office Monday, said it had obtained three letters it 
believed were mailed by the ''<strong>Unabomber'</strong>' days before the attack. The New York Times reported yesterday it had received 
one of the letters, in which the writer said he would stop the killings if a 
news organization with nationwide circulation published a lengthy article 
written by him.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">CIA director-nominee Deutch faced Senate questioning yesterday on terror 
bombings in the US and on CIA failure to fully inform Congress about Guatemalan 
killings involving Americans. Deutch said he would shake up the CIA to make it 
more effective against a perceived threat from international terror.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Senate Budget Committee chairman Domenici said balancing the budget 
will be so tough that he will likely have to delay presentation of his spending 
plan beyond its scheduled release Monday. Budget hearings are to begin today or 
tomorrow. Domenici's proposal includes a freeze on military spending and caps 
on entitlements such as Medicare and Medicaid.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Senators Domenici and Nunn introduced a bill to replace the current US tax 
system with one that allows unlimited deductions for savings and investments. 
They said the chief goal of the plan was to raise the level of national savings 
by allowing money an individual saves or invests to be deducted from income.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Orders to US factories for big-ticket durable goods rose 0.6 percent in March, 
rebounding from their first decline in four months, the Commerce Department 
reported. The increase surprised analysts, who had predicted a second straight 
drop.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A Senate committee 
approved a diluted package of medical-malpractice-liability reforms. The 
reforms would allow a state to gain an exemption by passing a law declaring 
that the federal statute did not apply to malpractice disputes within its 
borders.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Supreme Court was to hear arguments on whether the Ku Klux Klan was 
discriminated against when Columbus, Ohio, city officials refused to let the 
group erect a 10-foot cross as part of a holiday display. The high court threw 
out a federal law that bans possession of a gun within 1,000 feet of a school. 
The court also ruled that states can regulate hospital costs by charging 
different rates based on a patient's health-care coverage. The decision 
reinstates part of New York's hospital-reimbursement system, saying it is not 
pre-empted by federal law.


</p><p class="body" align="Left">The World
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Russia will create a new army for the volatile North Caucasus region in a move 
that will breach limits laid down in a key disarmament pact, Interfax news 
agency said. Russian General Semyonov said the new 58th Army would be in place 
by June 1. He did not specify the number of troops involved or where the Army 
would be based. And Russia said it may withdraw its peacekeepers from Bosnia if 
warring parties fail to extend a truce.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Group of Seven officials meeting in Washington said the dollar had declined 
beyond ''justified'' levels indicated by underlying economic conditions. They 
said the dollar's battered course should be reversed but offered no specific 
plan on how to do so. Although they have bickered heatedly in the past 
about measures to bolster the dollar, G7 members kept a unified front after the 
meeting. Japanese Finance Minister Takemura, however, claimed the consensus was 
a victory for Japan's campaign to bolster the dollar.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">More than 200,000 refugees chased from camps in southwest Rwanda have returned 
to their home villages, aid workers said, but hundreds reportedly armed with 
rifles and grenades held out against eviction. The Hutus were fleeing the 
Kibeho camp, where 2,000 were killed by the Army Saturday in its efforts to 
force refugees to return to their homes. At least nine were killed on the way 
home, the UN said. (Editorial, Page 20.)

</p><p class="body" align="Left">South Africa celebrates its first anniversary of democracy today. Thousands of 
Zulus loyal to conservative Chief Buthelezi were expected to march in 
Johannesburg, demanding more power for post-apartheid South 
Africa's regional governments. While poverty among blacks has not yielded much 
in the past year, violence and political antagonism have lessened. (Story, Page 
5.)

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The pro-Iranian Hizbullah group in southern Lebanon mobilized its guerrillas 
for an expected Israeli revenge attack. A Hizbullah suicide car-bombing attack 
Tuesday wounded 11 Israeli soldiers. (Story, Page 1.)

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The first international war-crimes tribunal since World War II opened in the 
Hague and will seek to mete out justice for alleged atrocities in Bosnia. 
Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic pleaded innocent to charges of murder, rape, and 
crimes against humanity, all allegedly committed in Serb-held Bosnia in 
mid-1992. Top Bosnian Serb leaders also have been named as suspects by the 
tribunal. UN forces in Bosnia, meanwhile, conceded that they may have to yield 
to Serb demands to restrict civilian use of Sarajevo's airport.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Argentina's Army commander stated on TV that the nation's military had in fact 
killed political opponents during the ''Dirty War'' against leftists from 1976 
to 1983. The admission shattered two decades of official silence.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Japan took delivery in Mutsu Ogawara of 14 tons of radioactive waste shipped 
from France, while police scuffled with dozens of protesters. As police staged 
an intense series of raids on sect sites, the leader of Aum Shinri Kyo, 
suspected in the March 20 gas attack on Tokyo's subway, warned in a book that 
the ''gods will explode with anger'' if the police attacks on the cult do not 
stop.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Iraq signed a cooperation deal with 
Russia to expand oil and gas transportation networks and refinery equipment. 
Russia will also help develop Iraq's southern oil fields. A Russian news agency 
said the projects will go ahead only after the UN lifts sanctions on Iraq.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Thousands of children marched in Lahore, Pakistan, to mark the killing of Iqbal 
Masih, a 12-year-old boy who had protested child labor in Pakistan's rug 
industry.


</p><p class="body" align="Left">Etcetera
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Ginger Rogers, who died Tuesday at her home in Rancho Mirage, will be 
remembered for the 10 musicals in which she danced and sang with Fred Astaire. 
But she was much more than Astaire's dancing partner. She won an Academy Award 
for her dramatic performance in ''Kitty Foyle.'' She also had a flair for 
comedy. Her career spanned 65 years, from 
vaudeville to television. (Editorial, Page 20.)

</p><p class="body" align="Left">An examination of 1,430 Chinese products has found more than one-third to be 
substandard, news reports from Beijing say. State inspectors declared almost 
half the goods made by individuals or village enterprises defective. Only 1.6 
percent of cross-bred corn seeds passed quality tests, reports said.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">A statue of the bear that inspired A. A. Milne's children's stories about 
Winnie the Pooh is to be erected at the London Zoo as a gift from Canada. The 
real bear was the mascot of a Canadian regiment stationed in Britain in 1914. 
Canada is donating the statue, a replica of one in Winnipeg.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Dizzy Gillespie's original bent-bell trumpet went for $ 63,000 on the auction 
block at Christie's in New York. Its bell was bent 
45 degrees when a dancer tripped while performing at a birthday party for 
Gillespie's wife in the '50s. The bent bell became his trademark. ''I can hear 
my mistakes quicker,'' the late trumpeter once said.

 ''We should be extremely cautious in using this incident to rush 
legislation through ... that might take us back to Vietnam and civil rights 
days.'' - Morris Dees, co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center, on 
antiterrorism efforts
