</p><p class="body" align="Left">Panel urges closing Pennsylvania Avenue
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
</p><p class="body" align="Left">An advisory committee examining security at the White House has recommended 
closing Pennsylvania Avenue, which runs in front of the building, after experts 
determined that a truck bomb outside the gates could do enough damage to injure 
people inside, sources familiar with the overview said. The concern predated 
the April 19 Oklahoma City blast, but that bomb's power underscored the threat 
to the White House, sources said.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">U.S. refugee policy
</p><p class="body" align="Left">
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Cuban exiles angry over the new U.S. policy of sending back all Cuban boat 
people shut down a Miami expressway as the first group of 13 refugees awaited 
their forcible return. Eastbound traffic on Hwy. 836 backed up for several 
miles for about 45 minutes as exiles 
waved Cuban flags and massed in front of a tollbooth at midday.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Buchanan speaks out
</p><p class="body" align="Left">on immigration
</p><p class="body" align="Left">GOP presidential contender Pat Buchanan chided President Clinton and the 
Republican-controlled Congress for failing to secure America's borders and 
endorsed legislation that would deny automatic citizenship to children of 
illegal immigrants. He also called for legislation making English the country's 
official language, and for at least a doubling in the size of the Border Patrol.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Delaware gets OK
</p><p class="body" align="Left">for welfare overhaul
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Clinton administration gave Delaware permission to launch a statewide 
welfare reform plan that cuts off cash benefits after two years and requires 
teenage mothers to live at home. Under Delaware's experiment, adults on welfare 
will be required to sign a contract outlining the steps they must take to 
prepare for work, become self-sufficient and take responsibility for their 
children. 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Navy investigating
</p><p class="body" align="Left">captain's conduct
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Navy is investigating charges that a senior officer engaged in 
&quot;an unduly personal relationship&quot; with two female subordinates while he was director of the equal opportunity 
office in the Bureau of Navy Personnel, the service said. The officer, Capt. 
Everett L. Greene, was selected in November for promotion to one-star admiral, 
but the Senate is not expected to act on the nomination until the investigation 
is complete.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Pena opposes bill
</p><p class="body" align="Left">against seat belts
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Transportation Secretary Federico Pena defended laws intended to prevent death 
and injuries on the nation's highways. Pena and other safety advocates said 
laws - now under attack - requiring use of auto safety belts and motorcycle 
helmets and setting a national speed limit and minimum drinking age are 
lifesavers. A Senate 
subcommittee last week voted to amend the National Highway System bill to end 
the national speed limit, and amendments to drop the seat belt and motorcycle 
helmet requirements are under discussion. A House bill would also drop the 
federal requirement for a drinking age of 21.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">$ 1 billion requested 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">for military housing
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Calling the military's housing supply in terrible shape, Defense Secretary 
William Perry asked Congress for a $ 1 billion, five-year test to boost private 
involvement in renovating or rebuilding living quarters. He said 200,000 of the 
military's 350,000 housing units are in dire need of repair, given that the 
average age of the housing is 33 years.

FBI: Geneticist got
</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>Unabomber</strong> letter
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A letter received by a Nobel Prize-winning geneticist was sent by the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> 
on the same day as a package bomb that killed another man, the FBI confirmed. 
The bomber sent four letters from Oakland, Calif., on April 20 when he mailed 
the most recent bomb. One letter went to Richard J. Roberts at New England 
Biolabs in Beverly, Mass., near Boston.
