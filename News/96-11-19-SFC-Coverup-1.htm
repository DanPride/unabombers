 Notes from search kept from suspect's lawyers

</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A federal magistrate ruled yesterday that government prosecutors do not have 
to give attorneys of 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> suspect Theodore Kaczynski notes handwritten by federal agents when they were 
searching Kaczynski's Montana cabin for evidence in April.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">U.S. Magistrate Judge Gregory Hollows said those notes, which 
<strong>identify</strong> every federal agent who touched evidence in the cabin, were not material to 
Kaczynski's defense case. Hollows said he would issue a written ruling later 
this week.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">One of Kaczynski's attorneys, Judy Clarke, argued that these logs detailing 
''who went in and out of the cabin'' could show that the ''chain of custody'' 
in securing and examining the 22,000 pages of the 54-year-old former math 
professor's personal journals and other papers could have been 
''contaminated.'' 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">''This goes to the purity of evidence that was seized,'' Clarke said, ''and to 
who had custody of it.'' She said that it's possible one of the many agents who 
inspected a given piece of evidence could have removed a page from it. If the 
defense knows only the name of the original agent who seized the evidence and 
not the names of other agents who examined it, the chain of custody would be 
broken.  Ultimately, using this broken-chain-of- custody theory, the defense 
could lead a jury to believe that a government agent had filched a document 
that could have been useful to the defense.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Prosecutors, however, said they have bent over backward to 
provide the defense with material gathered during the 17-year history of the 
UNABOM case, but this latest request was too much.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">''We have to establish a limit,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Freccero said 
of the government's decision to withhold the logs from Clarke and federal 
Public Defender Quin Denvir. ''And so we draw the line here because those are 
internal government documents.'' In court records filed last week, government 
prosecutors argued that ''disclosure of internal files often raises serious 
concerns about the privacy rights'' of 
<strong>witnesses</strong> and victims, as well as the ''confidentiality'' of the government's 
investigative methods.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Federal prosecutors also said that at Kaczynski's trial they plan to introduce 
evidence of ''actual or planned bombing incidents other than those charged in 
the indictment, as well as additional acts of actual or planned violence and 
vandalism.'' The government did not elaborate what those alleged acts might be.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Kaczynski, who was not present in 
court yesterday, was arrested at his cabin April 3 and indicted by a Sacramento 
federal grand jury 10 weeks later on charges of killing two men in Sacramento 
in 1985 and 1995 and with injuring a Yale University professor and a University 
of California at San Francisco geneticist with bombs sent through the mail.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Kaczynski has also been indicted in the mail-bomb slaying of a New Jersey 
advertising executive and with three other bombing incidents linked to the 
<strong>Unabomber.</strong> In all, the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> is suspected of killing three and injuring 23 in 16 incidents between May 1978 
and April 1995.
