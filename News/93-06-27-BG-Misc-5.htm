</p><p class="body" align="Left">After parcel bombs seriously injured professors at Yale University and the 
University of California at San Francisco last week, federal authorities and 
university police across the country issued instructions on how to recognize 
suspicious packages.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the first place, officials said, packages need not be especially large to 
contain an explosive device.  
For example, the parcel bombs that blew up in the hands of California professor 
Charles Epstein and Yale professor David Gelernter were contained in 8 
1/2-by-11-inch Manila envelopes apparently delivered by the US Postal Service.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">To avoid injury, officials urged university personnel to use caution when 
opening any unexpected packages. They also said that packages should be 
regarded as suspicious if they appear lopsided, overwrapped or are marked with 
oily stains, excessive postage, unfamiliar return addresses or misspelled words.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">According to a warning issued by Harvard University police, at least one of the 
parcel bombs that exploded last week bore the return address of James Hill. 
Hill is chairman of the chemistry department at California State University in 
Sacramento and is not considered a suspect in the 
<strong>Unabom</strong> case.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In 
addition, the warning said that one of the parcels contained a videocassette 
box, wood fragments, copper tubing and batteries and urged extreme caution when 
opening packages that seem to contain these materials.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Harvard University Police Lt. Larry Murphy also said he is urging university 
personnel to use common sense when opening their mail.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Basically, if you're suspicious of a mailing and are unable to identify the 
contents or the sender, we're recommending that you do not open the package,&quot; he said.
