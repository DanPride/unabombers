</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> By James Verniere 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bombings of the World Trade Center and the Federal building in Oklahoma 
City had an eerie familiarity for filmgoers. Suddenly and horribly, something 
that had happened almost routinely in the pulp-fictional world of movies had 
come true in real life. It was a new dawn. An America ravaged and held hostage 
by a lunatic fringe was no longer some action filmmaker's pop nightmare. It was 
our deadly reality.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Die Hard With a Vengeance,&quot; 
&quot;True Lies,&quot; 
&quot;Speed,&quot; 
&quot;The Specialist&quot; and 
&quot;Blown Away&quot; are just a few of the recent mainstream films in which characters use 
explosives to try to settle scores on American soil. Indeed, one film, 
&quot;True Lies,&quot; uses the atomic vaporization of a Florida key by Arab terrorists as a backdrop 
for a kiss. While it is 
true Alfred Hitchcock often used terrorist activities as the basis for his 
films, the recent proliferation of bomb-tossing loonies on our screens seems 
symptomatic of a haunted nation.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">We're haunted because, although we were once spared such things, acts of 
terrorism have occurred here and seem likely to occur in the future. Murders at 
abortion clinics and U.S. post offices have stripped us of our national 
innocence. The events in Oklahoma City uncovered a network of self-styled 
Rambos spreading hate, paranoia and gun craziness on the airwaves and the 
information highway.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The sarin nerve gas attacks attributed to the Aum Shinri Kyo sect in Tokyo 
indictate America is not the only nation facing a threat from within, but 
that's scant comfort. Recent reports of 
&quot;pilgrimages&quot; to Waco, Texas, suggest the home of the Branch Davidian sect has become the 
Graceland of right-wing crazies. Suddenly, the land of the free and the home of 
the brave seems like nutcase central.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Adding to the tense atmosphere, the disintegration of the former Soviet Union 
and the rise there of such hate-mongering ultranationalists as Vladimir 
Zhirinovsky has raised concerns about abandoned and unguarded nuclear missile 
silos and black-market, weapons-grade plutonium. Indeed, the current trial of 
three men for attempting to smuggle such plutonium into Munich, perhaps with 
the aid of the Munich secret police, tells us that such fears are 
well-grounded. Thus, it doesn't take much of a leap of faith to 
believe the plot of the current, Tom Clancy-style techno-thriller 
&quot;Crimson Tide,&quot; in which an ultranationalist Russian leader takes control of a missile site 
and threatens to fire his deadly 
&quot;birds&quot; at the United States and Japan.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Similarly, in 
&quot;True Lies,&quot; Arab terrorists in America are the recipients of nuclear arms smuggled out of 
the former Soviet Union. In 
&quot;Under Seige,&quot; well-trained American malcontents hijack a battleship armed with nuclear 
missiles and hold the country ransom. Such films, together with the 
bio-thrillers 
&quot;Outbreak&quot; and the upcoming 
&quot;Twelve Monkeys,&quot; suggest a mood of paranoia and doom has descended upon us.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Although we recently celebrated the end of the Cold War, we still suffer from 
the paranoia that war spawned because it is apparently grounded in a terrible 
reality.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Certainly, mad bombers have been a staple of action 
films and B-movies for decades. The idea of a deranged person getting his hands 
on a nuclear weapon goes as far back as the Cold War classic 
&quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; (1964). The racist caricature, Fu Manchu, star of a film series in the '30s 
and '60s, constantly threatened to destroy the West with the equivalent of an 
atomic bomb (and to ravish its women). Similarly, at least half the James Bond 
villains have been global terrorists. Indeed, four letters in the acronym 
SPECTER - the name of the organization Bond often battles - stand for 
&quot;counterespionage, terrorism, extortion and revenge.&quot; A terrorist bomb goes off in a London department store killing and maiming 
several children in the opening scene in the 1981 thriller 
&quot;Nighthawks.&quot; 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Recent events have given many such movie scenarios a frightening 
resonance. In 
&quot;Blown Away,&quot; Tommy Lee Jones plays a terrorist bomber seeking revenge against a former 
colleague by blowing up his friends and associates, 
<strong>Unabomber</strong>-style. The character Dennis Hopper plays in 
&quot;Speed&quot; is the plastique-armed equivalent of a disgruntled postal worker. In light of 
the emerging details about suspected Oklahoma City bomber Timothy J. McVeigh, 
these films now seem all too plausible.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Do these films titilate or incite the mentally unstable? Maybe to alarmists 
clamoring for new government controls and a stronger FBI in the wake of the 
Oklahoma tragedy. But I don't think you'll find a tape of Alfred Hitchock's 
classic 
&quot;Sabotage&quot; (1937) among Timothy McVeigh's personal effects.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In that film, an adaptation of Joseph Conrad's novel 
&quot;The Secret Agent,&quot; 
a saboteur (Oscar Homolka) working for a nameless organization plants bombs all 
over London using a movie theater as a front (no doubt a mordant joke about 
so-called detrimental effects of Hitchock's medium). The film features a bomb 
going off in a bus and killing innocent bystanders. Reportedly, some countries 
subsequently refused to show 
&quot;Sabotage.&quot; Brazil banned it outright, claiming it was 
&quot;a handbook for terrorists on the building and planting of bombs.&quot; Sound familiar?
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Hitchock returned to the subject of terrorism in 
&quot;Saboteur&quot; (1942), a World War II era thriller based on a screenplay by Peter Viertel (&quot;The African Queen&quot;), Joan Harrison, Dorothy Parker and Hitchcock. In it, an innocent man (Robert 
Cummings) is implicated in an act of arson at a military plant and must track 
down and stop the real culprits while eluding a nationwide police net. The 
film, which features an unforgettable climax staged atop the Statue of Liberty, 
suggests a wartime plan to destroy Boulder Dam and wreak havoc at the Brooklyn 
Navy Yards. Notably, Hitchcock was criticized by the Navy for inserting into 
the film a newsreel shot of the S.S. Normandie, which had been sunk by a 
mysterious fire, suggesting it had been sabotaged. Later, Hitchock was 
allegedly kept under surveillance by the FBI when the plot of his 1946 film, 
&quot;Notorious,&quot; suggested correctly that uranium was the prime ingredient in a new, 
catastrophic form of explosive.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Hitchcock was renowned for using monuments and historical landmarks to create a 
sense of both America's 
grandeur and its vulnerability. Taking a cue from the master, Thomas Harris, 
author of 
&quot;The Silence of the Lambs,&quot; used the Super Bowl game as a backdrop for the climax to his novel, 
&quot;Black Sunday.&quot; In John Frankenheimer's film version, a blimp laden with explosives dives into 
the stadium as the Super Bowl is being played.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Although Washington likes to point the finger of blame at Hollywood at times of 
national crisis, it might be argued that films sometimes alert us to danger 
long before the government does. Such a claim might now be made by director 
Constantin Costa-Gavras, whose 1988 box-office failure 
&quot;Betrayed&quot; seems prophetic. The film begins with the assassination of a Chicago radio 
personality (an allusion to the 1984 killing of Denver talk show host Alan 
Berg) and includes a scene in which an undercover 
FBI agent attends a 
&quot;family picnic&quot; in the heartland where members of the KKK, neo-Nazis, survivalists and other 
right-wing nuts spout racist slogans and rail against ZOG (the Zionist 
Occupation Goverment) and the federal authorities.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Although the film, which was written by Joe Eszterhas (&quot;Basic Instinct&quot;) is seriously flawed, its portrait of the heartland as a breeding ground of 
right-wing paranoia seems timely indeed. In fact, a trail of pyschic DNA seems 
to link Timothy McVeigh and his ilk to 
&quot;Betrayed&quot; and other films in which malcontents threaten our nation's security. Perhaps 
it's proof that at the movies we felt their presence long before we knew their 
names.
