LOBBYISTS STYMIE EFFORT TO TRACE EXPLOSIVES;
BOMBS: TECHNOLOGY, SUCH AS USE OF TINY CHIPS IN MATERIAL, TO FIND BLAST ORIGIN 
HAS BEEN AROUND FOR YEARS. BUT NRA, OTHERS HAVE BLOCKED ITS USAGE.

</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Technology to help investigators trace the origin of explosives after bombings 
such as the one in Oklahoma City was developed more than 15 years ago, but the 
National Rifle Assn. and others, citing safety concerns, have lobbied 
successfully over the years to block its implementation.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">This week, President Clinton proposed using so-called 
&quot;taggants&quot; to trace bomb-making material as part of his broad package of counterterrorism 
proposals.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Once again, it appears the issue may not be settled without a difficult battle.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">On one side stand federal law enforcement authorities who say that adequate 
technology has long been available to place indestructible microscopic chips 
into dynamite, gun powder and other explosives so they can be traced back to 
the manufacturer, wholesaler and even the customer who bought the product.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Opposing the measure are some manufacturing groups, including the Institute of 
Makers of Explosives. They question the safety, cost and effectiveness of 
taggants, particularly in bombs made with ammonium nitrate, a key ingredient in 
the Oklahoma City blast.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">An NRA spokesman declined to answer questions Thursday. In the past, the group 
has consistently opposed taggants in gun powder, contending they could affect 
the trajectory of bullets and also amount to a de facto form of federal weapons 
registration.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">*
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The debate over taggants first arose in the late 1970s, when the Treasury 
Department and other government agencies pushed for legislation to require 
taggants in all explosives manufactured within the United States.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The impetus was a series of five major bombings in the United States, including 
two in New York City in 1975. One bomb hidden 
in a locker in La Guardia Airport killed 11 people and injured 75; another 
explosion at a historic tavern in the city killed four people.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Among those who argued at the time that taggants could prove a valuable tool 
was Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms special agent Larry Cornelison, who served on 
a team that tested and promoted the microscopic materials.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Cornelison, now an ATF supervisor in Los Angeles, says that if it weren't for 
opposition from gun and explosives lobbyists, taggants could have been used to 
help solve not only the April 19 bombing in Oklahoma City but also the 
long-unsolved 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> serial attacks, the World Trade Center car bombing and a host of other cases.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;I can think of any number of incidents where we had bombings . . . where it 
could have been very 
beneficial,&quot; Cornelison said Thursday. 
&quot;In Oklahoma City, there would have been a good investigative lead -- it would 
have been very valuable to know just where this explosive material came from.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The legislative momentum diminished in 1980 upon release of a report by 
congressional researchers. The Office of Technology Assessment study showed 
that taggants could increase arrests related to bombings by as much as 75%. But 
it also suggested additional safety tests before requiring taggants in all 
explosives.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">ATF agents countered that the technology was safe. But lobbying groups 
including the NRA, which had pushed to exempt black and smokeless powders from 
the list of explosives to be tagged, won the day, prevailing by a single vote 
before a Senate committee.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">More recently, the issue failed to even come to a vote following its initial 
inclusion in a domestic anti-terrorism 
bill introduced by Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) after the 1993 trade center 
bombing.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Clinton, in his initiative this week, called for passage of legislation to 
require that, within one year, taggants be included in the raw materials used 
in standard explosive devices. Clinton also asked for congressional permission 
for ATF to study and report on new technologies that would help detect 
concealed explosives.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">At a White House press briefing Wednesday, Deputy Atty. Gen. Jamie Gorelick 
said the ATF should investigate whether 
&quot;you could put taggants in something like a fertilizer, or whether you could 
render it inert in some way.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Ronald K. Noble, undersecretary of the Treasury Department, added that in the 
Oklahoma bombing, taggants in the ingredients used to detonate the ammonium 
nitrate could have been traced and detected.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">*
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Noble also 
said that the Administration is currently focusing on the use of taggants in 
explosives rather than in gunpowder. In the late 1970s, when the NRA sought to 
exempt gunpowder, Treasury officials said it was important to include it 
because gunpowder was often used by terrorist bombers.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The Institute of Makers of Explosives issued a strong statement Thursday 
opposing any requirement that microscopic chips be placed in explosives.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The prepared statement declared that taggants would present a safety problem 
&quot;during the manufacture of the explosive and during the use of the explosive by 
miners, quarry companies and construction companies.&quot;
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The problem, the IME said, is that the chips can affect the stability of 
explosives, exposing workers to safety perils.
