</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI is investigating possible links between serial
murderer and avowed white supremacist Donald LeRoy Evans and
suspects in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In a terse, often heated conversation in Evans' Florida jail
cell this week, Evans and FBI Agent John Peterson of Miami
discussed the Oklahoma bombing and possible future bombings by
white supremacist groups.  The discussion then turned to Evans'
theory that the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> who has sent numerous mail bombs since
the late 1970s, is associated with mass murderer Charles Manson.  

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Evans also repeated his long-standing demand that he be held
as a federal prisoner in accordance with a 1991 agreement he
reached with a U.S. District Court.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Evans, who has been convicted of the rape-murder of a
10-year-old girl in Mississippi, is one of an untold number of
persons the FBI has queried about both bombing cases.  Evans,
however, is defending himself in his current capital murder trial
for the murder of a prostitute in Fort Lauderdale, so he has a
phone in his cell.  Insisting that a third party monitor the
exchange Tuesday morning, he dialed a Chronicle reporter and held
the receiver between himself and Peterson.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI agent would not discuss the matter with the Chronicle.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI, prompted by rumors that another bomb would be set
off in New Orleans on July 4, apparently 
sought out Evans because
of his association with violent, white supremacist groups and his
roots in Michigan, former home of bombing suspect Terry Nichols.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">During his Florida trial he has shaved his head, assumed the name
&quot;&quot;Hi Hitler'' and spent a period of about two weeks on a radio
call-in show in which he voiced white supremacist views.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">In the FBI interview Tuesday, Evans told the agent he did not
know Nichols or fellow suspect Timothy McVeigh, but knew of others
who did.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;&quot;There are a lot of groups out there.  We've got people out
there you don't know about,'' said Evans.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;&quot;If you don't believe me now, you can come back and see me
on my birthday (July 5),'' he said.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Evans then turned the conversation to the 
<strong>Unabomber,</strong> an
unknown individual believed to have sent letter bombs that have
killed three 
people and injured 23 since 1978.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The bomber has targeted what he calls 
&quot;&quot;techno-nerds'' in the
computer industry and various executives in other industries.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Evans told Peterson he believes the bomber is allied with
Air, Trees, Water and Animals (A.T.W.A.), a group started by
Charles Manson after his imprisonment in 1971 and run by his
longtime follower, Sandra Goode, in Hanford, Calif.  The group
combines white supremacy and 
&quot;&quot;a holy war against pollution'' and
receives money from the sale of Mansons' art work and personalized
articles to collectors.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;&quot;Think about it,'' Evans told the agent.  
&quot;&quot;You've got
airline executives bombed, a timber executive, an Exxon executive
who was involved in the cleanup from the Valdez (oil spill) and
geneticists who work with animals.  The whole thing sounds like
Charlie. ''
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Goode 
said she was unaware of who the 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> or his
victims were and was unaware of any FBI investigation of her group.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Evans ended the discussion with a demand to be moved from his
current cell in the Broward County jail to a federal facility in
Miami.  Evans has consistently referred to an agreement with a U.S.
District Court, signed at his arrest in 1991, which states he is to
be held as a federal prisoner.  He has complained that he is not
allowed to smoke in the county jail.
