</p><p class="subheader" align="Left"><strong>BYLINE:</strong> Compiled by Yvonne Zipp, Suman Bandrapalli, and Peter Nordahl 



</p><p class="body" align="Left"><strong>BODY:</strong>
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The US
</p><p class="body" align="Left">A constitutional amendment that would have made it tougher to raise federal 
taxes failed in the House. The amendment, which would have required a 
two-thirds majority for Congress to raise taxes, was 37 votes short. But 
Republicans still claimed it was a political victory. Also, the House was 
expected to pass a bill that would give individual taxpayers more leverage with 
the IRS. The bill would establish a special advocate for taxpayers and raise to 
$ 1 million the amount they can seek in lawsuits against the agency.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Congress is set to pass an antiterrorism bill after a year of wrangling. The 
legislation bans US-fund-raising by groups linked to terrorism, expedites some 
deportations, and provides $ 1 billion in funding over four years to combat 
terrorism. It would also limit the number of appeals by death-row inmates. President Clinton is likely to sign the bill. Separately, the 
House is expected to vote tomorrow on overriding Clinton's veto on banning 
so-called partial birth abortions. An override is likely in the House, but the 
Senate was shy of the two-thirds majority needed.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">States must let criminal defendants avoid trial if it seems likely they are 
mentally unfit, the Supreme Court ruled. The court threw out an Oklahoma 
death-row inmate's murder conviction, saying the state made it too hard for him 
to prove he was mentally incompetent and he should not have stood trial.
 

</p><p class="body" align="Left">&quot;Deliberate disclosures&quot; by federal investigators have made it impossible for 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> suspect Theodore Kaczynski to get a fair trial, his lawyer said. He filed a 
motion in a Helena, Mont., federal court seeking to have the charges dismissed. 
The motion says that if the government denies responsibility for the leaks, he 
will put reporters on the stand and demand they 
<strong>identify</strong> their sources. Also, a list of more than 600 items the FBI seized as evidence 
from Kaczynski's cabin was released by a US District Court Judge. (See list at 
right.)

</p><p class="body" align="Left">About 20 US citizens remain unaccounted for in Liberia, but they may have 
escaped the country on their own, the State Department said. The US has 
evacuated 306 of the 470 US citizens in the war-torn country, and the rest 
either wish to stay or are unable to 
reach the US embassy.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The US military mission in Haiti ends today when the last combat troops fly 
out. The mission began 18 months ago when President Clinton ordered 20,000 US 
soldiers to Haiti to help restore President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Clinton wants to cut about $ 400 million from weapons purchases and military 
research to help pay for the Bosnia peacekeeping mission and an antidrug 
effort. The White House would like to put $ 250 million into the antidrug 
effort and $ 150 million toward the Bosnia mission.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">The court-martial of two Marines who refused to provide blood samples for a DNA 
registry used to 
<strong>identify</strong> soldier's remains was expected to end. The two corporals say the information 
could be used against them in the future and say the order is unconstitutional. 
They face a six-month 
prison sentence and a dishonorable discharge.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Technology that would give US viewers super-sharp television pictures beamed 
out of a station for the first time. Using a special transmitter, Las Vegas 
station KLAS sent a high definition broadcast, a digital format developed for 
US television, to the National Association of Broadcasters convention. But 
viewers won't be seeing the new format in their living rooms anytime soon. To 
receive the digital format, consumers will have to buy special TV sets that 
won't be on the market for several years.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Industrial output fell 0.5 percent in March, a result of the GM strike, the 
Federal Reserve announced. But excluding the strike, output rose 0.3 percent.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Investor Bennett LeBow conceded defeat in his six-month effort to 
split up the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. into separate food and tobacco 
businesses, a day before shareholders were to vote on the issue.


</p><p class="body" align="Left">The World
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Israeli helicopters rocketed Beirut as well as Lebanon's largest Palestinian 
refugee camp near Sidon, hitting the home of a guerrilla leader. Three 
Palestinians were wounded. The attack suggests that Israel is widening the 
scope of a six-day-old onslaught against Shiite Muslim militants and their 
allies, analysts said. The attacks came a few hours after Hizbullah guerrillas 
fired two new salvos of Katyusha rockets on northern Israel. There were no 
reports of casualties. And the US is mediating to end the fighting, Israeli 
Prime Minister Peres said.  (Story, Page 6.)

</p><p class="body" align="Left">President Clinton and South Korean President Kim Young Sam invited North Korea 
and China to talks 
aimed at finding peace for the divided Korean Peninsula. The proposal was 
announced at a joint press conference on Cheju Island, South Korea. A top North 
Korean diplomat rejected the offer and maintained that Pyongyang favors 
negotiations with the US alone. In Beijing, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said 
China wanted to play a 
&quot;constructive&quot; role, but it was still weighing a decision to back the offer. Separately, 
Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto were to issue a 
declaration today strengthening the 1960 US-Japan security alliance. (Story, 
Page 5.)

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera ordered market reforms aimed at rescuing 
the country's faltering economy. The currency was devalued, exchange controls 
were lifted, and gasoline prices hiked 850 percent. The measures are intended 
to curb the 
inflation - the highest in Latin America - shrink the fiscal deficit, and 
attract foreign investment.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Tomorrow's Dayton accord deadline for Balkan factions to move soldiers to 
barracks and heavy weapons to storage areas is unlikely to be met, said NATO 
spokesman Maj. Simon Haselock.  But the three parties - Bosnian Muslims, 
Croats, and Bosnian Serbs - have stepped up efforts to comply, he said. And an 
explosion rocked Belgrade's only mosque for the second time in a month, causing 
some damage but no casualties.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Russia extradited former Azeri Defense Minister Ragim Gaziyev to Azerbaijan, 
where he faces charges in connection with attempted coups, the Russian 
prosecutor's office said.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Looting and rebel violence continued in Monrovia, Liberia's capital. Rival 
factions were using small arms and rocket-propelled grenades, 
<strong>witnesses</strong> 
said. Meanwhile, Nigeria's Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi said his country was 
considering withdrawing its peacekeeping troops. Nigeria forms the backbone of 
the West African peacekeeping force that intervened at the beginning of the 
Liberian civil war in 1989. (Story, Page 7.)

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> Colombian rebels ambushed a military convoy near the Ecuadoran border, killing 
31 soldiers and wounding 18. The Army blamed the Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia, the largest and oldest of the rebel groups, for the attack.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Moscow's nuclear summit this weekend will discuss the safety of atomic 
reactors, the fate of Chernobyl 10 years after the world's worst nuclear 
accident, and how to stop the illicit trade in nuclear materials. (Story, Page 
1.)

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Mexico City citizens will get to elect their mayor for the first time. Leading 
political parties have agreed to a 
plan to elect the mayor, who has always been appointed by the president. The 
measure and other electoral reforms still need congressional approval.


</p><p class="body" align="Left">Etceteras
</p><p class="body" align="Left">Women are involved in only 15 percent of front-page newspaper stories, even 
though they make up 52 percent of the US population. That's the bottom line in 
the eighth annual survey of news coverage of women sponsored by the group Men, 
Women, and Media. When women were covered, more than half were either victims 
or perpetrators of crimes, the survey found.
</p><p class="body" align="Left">London has announced plans to build a 500-foot high Ferris wheel, the world's 
tallest. The project, which is expected to cost $ 14 million, will stand on the 
south bank of the Thames River and be 200 feet taller than the clock tower at 
Parliament known as Big Ben.

</p><p class="body" align="Left">Crossbow bolt tips provided the crucial evidence 
linking a campsite in a Texas Panhandle canyon to the lost trail of 
16th-century Spanish explorer Francisco Coronado. Only his expedition carried 
crossbows, said Donald Blakeslee, a professor at Wichita State University in 
Kansas.


</p><p class="body" align="Left">Kaczynski's Cabin
</p><p class="body" align="Left">The FBI seized more than 600 items as evidence from 
<strong>Unabomber</strong> suspect Theodore Kaczynski's cabin. Items seized included:

</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 2. Improvised explosive device
</p><p class="body" align="Left"> 3. Pipe bomb

<strong>Unabomber's</strong> 
&quot;manifesto.
