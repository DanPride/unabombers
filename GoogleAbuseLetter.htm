<pre>Thank you for agreeing to forward this memo to the
abuse section with your observations which we
discussed on the phone.
The problem is as follows.
In reviewing my search terms for 5/27/2002 the 8th
term listed was aptosseanmurder. This caught my
attention since sean is a witness mentioned on my site
whom we suspect may have been murdered. I tried to run
this down. I entered the search term in google trying
to replicate the method by which the search found the
site and Google returned the following
 -------------------
Your search - aptosseanmurder - did not match any
documents. 
No pages were found containing &quot;aptosseanmurder&quot;.
Suggestions:
Make sure all words are spelled correctly.
Try different keywords.
Try more general keywords.
--------------------
How could a search which had found my site 24 hours
previously not return a value ?? I called support and
during the discussion the tech claims that for the
date of 5-27-2002 - Search engine - Google that her
listing was dramatically different that mine and it
did not mention aptosseanmurder. The gross volumes for
the dates also appear at variance with mine.
This is important because we strongly suspect sean was
murdered but the &quot;aptos&quot; implying the nearby location
of aptos california is totally new totally out of the
blue (and possibly evidence of something in a future
murder case). SO PLEASE TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY.
My urchin reports for 5-27-2002 - search engines -
